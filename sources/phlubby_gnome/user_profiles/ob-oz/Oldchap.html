<p>Demoscene music consumer since a teenager around 1996, or before, since I had already played games featuring scene music before I discovered the amazing world of .mod, .xm, .s3m, .mtm, .ult, etc.... Never composed or attended any scene parties/events, but have just listened for 20+ years. Having traveled, studied, or worked in close to 40 countries over the years, including many in Africa and the Middle East, Nectarine has been a reliable companion wherever Internet has been available. What an amazing cultural treasure Demoscene music is, so unknown to most, but probably having had a very far-reaching impact on many forms of mainstream music. May Demoscene music always live on forever!</p>

<p>Shame on the hacker, we will never forget what you did to this lovely virtual community...</p>
