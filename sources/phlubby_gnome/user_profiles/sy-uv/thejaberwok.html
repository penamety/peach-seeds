<p>not a musician or composer, I am more the &#39;end user&#39; type, I started using the Commodore 64 then progressed to bigger and better, last one was an A2500 with 2 250Mb h/d&#39;s 16Mb ram and a 68030 accelerator card .. sadly due to moving and lack of storage *SIGH* I had to part with all of the machines  &gt;&gt; 2xA2000 -- 1xA2500 -- 6xA500 (a plus in there as well) 2xA600 -- 1xA1000 and heaps of other things like graphics tablet (I never got to use it) about 10 external drives  and heaps of spares ..... but I had to move on as the room I rent is small and all that would have been way too much  anyway ..... good times<br /></p>
