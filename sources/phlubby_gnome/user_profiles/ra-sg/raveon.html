<p>
<p>I used to part of the demoscene group Polygon back in the 90&#39;s. I attended Assembly and I worked as a network guy in The Party 97 in Arhus (Denmark). I have been composing music since the days of the Amiga 500 until now and I am developing and renovating a large plot in the south of Spain to house a music and film studio. I have composed on trackers since Octamed, Protracker, Noisetracker, Fast Tracker II, Skaletracker and also used professional tools such as Protools and Cubase SX. I use an MKIII from MOTU, a RFX Zoom Effects processor and my trust Sony Laptop. I will be sending some of my modules and tracks to nectarine so If anyone wants to listen and any feedback appreciated.</p>
