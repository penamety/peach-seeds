<p>Ivan Preston was born in Vorkuta, a small mining town located beyond the Polar Circle. Since early childhood Ivan has been fond of music and musical instruments. At the age of seven he already had a full collection of albums of such great musicians as Pink Floyd, David Bowie, Deep Purple, Space. When Ivan was eleven, parents presented him with a computer and he made the first attempts at composing music. At that time it was primitive 4 channels trackers. The release of &#34;Music for the jilted generation&#34; by Prodigy (1993) marked the turning point in Preston’s creative development. The same year demo &#34;Second Reality&#34; by Future Crew introduced Preston to underground subculture demoscene and Ivan realised that he would like to dedicate his life. In 1995 scener Dune from “Orange” released several tracks that also influenced greatly Ivan’s works. Although Preston had his own project &#34;Pop corrosion&#34; then, he got in touch with Demoscene participants in Russia and tried to realize himself in this style. In 1998 Preston started to work as goatrance DJ at club “Night Moon”. This coincided with popularization of rave culture and by 2000 Ivan had become quite a popular and well-known DJ in Vorkuta. Working in different styles he favored mix which enables to combine various trends from funk and soul to gabber and techstep. In 2004 Ivan moved to Moscow and joined legendary russian demoscene group “The Sands”. At that time he worked o lot both as a musician and DJ. Then Preston decided to leave for St. Petersburg and try himself as a VJ. Later this interest became his main earning and resulted in foundation of demogroup &#34;Quite&#34; which dominates russian demoscene at the moment.</p>
