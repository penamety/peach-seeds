<p>Where the frell were you people when I was wasting my time on quake and doom and stuff?</p>

<p>Ages ago I would hear slips of music from this demoscene stuff only via vage osmosis.  I was big into playing doom wads, I got gigs of the stuff.  At some point id software released the source to doom.  SOmeone made a port, zdoom, that could play module music.  People started cramming shiny not-midi music into doom.  (That&#39;s not to say midi sucks or anything, but a good module can add some kick).  I liked some of it, pried it out.  Added it to my winamp playlist (Yes, I still use winamp, shuddup), even found the embedded text in these files that would give credits and thank yous to people I didn&#39;t have a darn clue who they were.  I tried searching for more of this music, didn&#39;t really find anything useful outside of the sites of people like Teque and artists who have since faded into the ravages of time.</p>

<p>Very recently I was talking to a DJ friend of mine, mentioned one of the tunes and he went &#34;oh, that&#39;s demoscene stuff&#34;.  It&#39;s amazing what one magic word can do in google search.  Once I had the magic word:  Demoscene.  I could find out neat things, like pouet, and this site.</p>

<p>So now I got the stream blasting a lot, and I gawk at you people saying things on the one liner.  I got a heap of these old files.  Lotta them teque, whoever likes embedding module music in doom wads really loved teque.  Lot of the teque tracks weren&#39;t bad.  I&#39;ll probably be hurling a few of them at your uploader and continue digging up copies of these demos and watching them on dosbox.  Thank goodness for emulation of old machines.</p>
