<p>Old timer who knows more scene-musician names and which demogroups they were in at certain years and what songs they made and even what productions they were used in, rather than remembering anything from school back then. ;P</p>

<p>Might be known as Olle.</p>

<p>Been/is into these groups, since the start in the Vic-20 days.</p>
