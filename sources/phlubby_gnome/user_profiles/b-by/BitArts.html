<p>Special skills: being old and still wake up in the morning.<br />------<br />Der Chiptune ist der natürliche Feind des sonophilen Menschen. <img src="/static/emoticons/meme/troll2.png" title=":troll:" /><br />------<br />Quote from Accidental&#39;s profile:</p>

<p>&#34;BitArts<br />24 June 2016 09:35<br />german news are lying like hell, pretending the pound experienced major losses last night. which is a plain LIE. the currency with a major loss is the €!&#34;</p>

<p>If you think, my quote on brexit and the € was funny, you obviously did not watch the U$ at the same time. As a matter of fact, none in german news talked about the € falling into deep, but only about the £, which created a quite wrong impression of &#34;It doesn&#39;t affect us at all, but the brits are fucked.&#34;. For german economy first of all the € and U$ matter. And the U$ went all the way up, while the € fell into deep. The overall value, that went down the drain this way, easily tops the value of the £ drop. When I remember right, I even posted the Yahoo Finance charts that morning, where the € falling and falling could be watched live. On german news just nobody talked about it. Strange, huh?</p>

<p>It&#39;s always good to understand more than just the obvious. Otherwise you easily make yourself look like the actual idiot.<br />------</p>
