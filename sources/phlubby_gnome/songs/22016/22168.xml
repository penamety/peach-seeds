 <info>this track is a remix of our &#34;strollin&#39; at 4am&#34;. that is also on this package. sometimes you feel that you&#39; sat around for too long and that it&#39;s time to get up and shake your legs. so go on, why are you still sitting in front of your screen?

this track made 6th place at mekka 2001&#39;s fast forward compo.</info>
