 <info>&#34;Hey all! Hivelytracker is a really wonderful tool, very user-friendly and wonderful for old tracker-composers like me. I seriously recommend it for anyone who has enjoyed Protracker, Odintracker, Goattracker, FasttrackerII or Renoise. But also for people who have used to sequencing - maybe this is the tracker that will let you realize the good side about tracking also! Greetings to all #amigascne people, Klegg, Parazite, my mom, Zetanet, Thoron, Siiseli, Genny and others that I forgot. Peace and love for all!&#34;</info>
