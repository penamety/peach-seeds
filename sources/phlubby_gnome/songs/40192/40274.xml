 <info>7 channels, 16.7kb, loops at about 3 mins. I&#39;d have faded it, but the C50-C90 commands don&#39;t really allow very smooth global fading ;) If necessary, I could fix it for the musicdisk with manual CXX commands in each channel...
There&#39;s some use of the 4XX filter override command, but I think this is fixed in all replayers now, so that&#39;s cool. 
Thanks again for a great tracker and a great port :)

&#34;Gartantuan greets to the usuals, with extra h&lt;3arts to xeron, spotUP and exobuzz for this amazing software and for their tireless feature implementations:D Words to d0pefish for all the hardware help and fuckings to parapete for killing the scene.&#34;</info>
