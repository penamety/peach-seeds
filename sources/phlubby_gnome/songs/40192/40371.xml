 <info>Revision 2014 Tracked Music Compo

Put together using a mixture of Cubase, Plugins and ProTracker v2.3D

Lyrics below, why not rap along with Daytripper?

: Chorus
Professional tracker
Progressive pattern hacker
31 samples of dirty subject matter
We got that Amiga Vision
You better bring your homework boy
Coz this is revision

: Verse
Yeah, we got the stank
Rocking all night to that pattern skank
Digging deep in the sample bank
Can&#39;t leave nothing Blank
Trample the tracks like a battle tank
Protracking in our sleep
Like androids counting 64 electric sleep
You can find us in the demoscene proud and raw
Surrounded by Amigas and 64s
1 bit, 2 bit, 3 bit more
7 bit, 8 bit - no more
We be making a play
With AV projects that are 64k
Main aim to win the day
Glitch hopping head bobbin&#39;
Ragamuffins never stopping
Track smashing, noise caching
Get the beat cracking
One more thing left before you go crackers
Shout out to the hackers, graphicians and pro trackers

: Chorus

: Verse
Hoffman breaking up the tracks
With Daytripper fillin&#39; in the gaps
Listen up, here&#39;s a fact
The demoscene ain&#39;t dead
It&#39;s just you can&#39;t read the code 
Better get it in your head
Before the deadline&#39;s closed
Text to form:
The fact of the matter is we&#39;ll batter you with stuff made before you were born
So listen up before you go crackers...
Shout out to the hackers, graphicians and pro trackers
