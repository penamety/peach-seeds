 <info>Born to stand against the wind, to struggle on my own
Against the countless masses I will fight until I&#39;m gone
Blackened, betrayed, tortured, forgotten and alone
A thousand lies I&#39;ve faced, but I will bow to none

They hate me for what I am, unsubdued and free
With cunning, stealth and might, I will not kneel

I sing of freedom, metal and might
Freedom, metal and might
When invaders come to kill us all, only agents dare to fight
To fight for freedom, metal and might

My mind is in turmoil, my eyes are burning bright
Through devouring rage and anger, I&#39;m getting ready to fight
The desperate cries of fallen brothers still echo in my head
Fooled by the lies of those in command till the price of blood was paid

The sceptics and the tyrants will claim we&#39;re bound to fail
But with burning will and power we will prevail
