	and now let&#39;s go with	
	the lyrics...........	
	&#34;lie on the floor and	
	 stare at the ceiling	
	the track is packed	
	      to the max with	
	              feeling	
	drop the tab and your	
	  senses are pampered	
	then and only then	
	    can you reach the
	       subby-standard	
	lunatics are here and	
	     making it mental	
	get you to the	
	maximum and then some	
	drill your mind are	
	 you feeling at home?	
	yeah? well welcome to	
	     the vagueodrome&#34;
