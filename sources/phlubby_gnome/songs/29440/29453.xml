[i]Lyrics:
Android Girl!
When she got into my life
I felt like heaven just came down to me
[???] perfect shape
Her lips are prob&#39;ly sweet as exctasy

She has [???] for every fantasy
Takes me to the stars above

And when I&#39;m fed up with her turning me on
I flip that little switch and turn her off

Android Girl
Never complains
Never [???]
Android Girl
Is just for me
Obeys my will

Some people think that I am weird
That living with a robot&#39;s somehow sad
Yet when they eat the food she makes
They all go like, &#34;Best meal I&#39;ve ever had&#34;
Mmmm. Yum

I&#39;m leading all the girls around
The ones who never looked at me before
They all are craving makeout tips
[???] crying on my door[/i]</info>
