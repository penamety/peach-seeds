      &#34;Truly, there can be no greater form of tracked music than the
       rock ballad.&#34;

    It&#39;s been a long time coming, but we finally got it done.  This has
    to  be one of  the most  moving pieces I  (Lemm) have  ever had the
    pleasure of working on.

    Jakob  (that&#39;s  Radix,  for those  of you who  haven&#39;t been  paying
    attention ;) ) gave me a helluva start off on this one. Most of the
    structure was laid out already;  all I had to do  was tie it up and
    finish it off. According to Jakob, I&#39;ve done a good job on it.

    Now THAT&#39;S a compliment. =)

    Greets must go out, of course,  to everyone in Analogue and Process
    Five, our respective groups.

    LEMM also greets:
      All the NAID 96 loonies... I *still* miss those days.
      The regular #trax crowd.  Thanks for rescuing me from countless
        nights of tiresome study. ;)
      EagleFalcon, for his tireless support and encouragement.

        Music Foundation. :)
      Welti, for supplying me with numerous fresh samples when I most
        needed them. =)
