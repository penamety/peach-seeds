 <info>STIL: Comments from Ben Daglish are denoted (BD)

A slightly remixed version of a tune &#34;which I&#39;d written a little while before, I think, for a game demo that was sent to whatever Gremlin was called before it was Gremlin - they had a little SW house over the &#39;Just Micro&#39; shop...&#34; (BD) It was possibly meant to be a tune for the game Rainbow Dragon, later released by Firebird, and it was never used.
