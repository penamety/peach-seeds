 <info>I&#39;m so psyched to present my brand new chiptune track called &#34;Douchebag Rumble&#34;, which is the first single from my upcoming album Superposition.

The album is set to be released in late January (or early February), including many never before released tracks as &#34;Chasing The Clouds&#34;, &#34;Ms. Bed Burrito&#34;, &#34;The Lonesome Droid&#34; and more.

Now it&#39;s officially xmas and I hope you&#39;re all having great 8-bit holiday. As it is xmas and all I&#39;ve decided to give you this download for free!

Hope you like it and please don&#39;t act like a douche on xmas :)

Comments and shares are welcome, cheers
