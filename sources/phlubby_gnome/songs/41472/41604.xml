 <info>This tune is a cheery, slightly hip-hop, quite bitpop, chippy, fairly brief, bunch of blippy beepy arpeggiated nonsense that I enjoyed tracking and still enjoy listening to. Originally slated for release on 31 Jan 2009, for some reason it never made it back then, must have been difficult circumstances or something, can&#39;t remember now.

Not much else to say, the tune speaks for itself. Enjoy with peppered assault.
