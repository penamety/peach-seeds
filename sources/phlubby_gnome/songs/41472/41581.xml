 <info>Don&#39;t listen with hardware mixing (ie. AWE32 or GUS) if possible- you&#39;ll
miss out on a LOT of notes. (both on reasons of pitch an number of notes)

If your computer can&#39;t handle the number of channels, lower the mixing
rate (as opposed to limiting the channels). The channels are more
important that high playback quality.
