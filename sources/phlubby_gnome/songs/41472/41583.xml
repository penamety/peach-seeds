 <info>The song written in one evening on a rainy August day when I was sitting home-alone and had no distractions. My trusty 7-year old iMac ran out of CPU power towards the end, so it&#39;s one of those songs that I can&#39;t actually listen to in Renoise, without rendering it first. One more reason to save money for a new computer.</info>
