 <info>Well, this one is dear to me... did a mix of this a long time ago in FT2, and now i did it again in Propellerheads Reason.
Basically, what i&#39;ve done with this remix is that i&#39;ve stripped away all the stuff i didn&#39;t like in the original tune, and instead put in a little more emphasis on the stuff i liked with it. I&#39;m a big fan of house music, so i made a nice little latino/salsa type rythm and added some nice bassdrum and bassline to the mix and to top it off, a nice south american style flute-ish sound for the lead.
Enjoy.
