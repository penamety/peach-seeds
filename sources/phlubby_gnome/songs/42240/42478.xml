 <info>This one is a re-mix of my Commodore 64 tune composed in 18.10.2015. For some reason is decided to re-mix it right away.
I played guitar parts and did midi drums using Sonar 8! ( seriously:)
Bass, arpeggios and other strange sounds are from Commodore 64 6581 SID rev 3. Hope you like this one!
Cheers!</info>
