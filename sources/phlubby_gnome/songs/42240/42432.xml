 <info>When i transfered it to my PC, i thought, &#39;God damn, distorted!&#39; &#39;Have to capture it new! :p
It&#39;s an analog recording with two Effect CPU&#39;s in between. I didn&#39;t get really how to fix the distortion. But next time, yeah? :)
Spheric[94] is taken from &#39;Spheric Crap Vol.1&#39; (by flash! :p) and has five components: A SidStation. An 8580 C64 two Effect Gears and a MSSIAH midi Cadridge connected to the Commodore. :-)</info>
