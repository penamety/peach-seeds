 <info>Petr Koval alias &#39;DjHawk&#39; wants me to write new music. And here: oila! It&#39;s name is: &#39;Love Unite&#39; and it&#39;s in version 1. I made a video showing the playing MilkyTracker window but it is not syncron. But maybe it will some day. :-)
I had to capture the sound seperately. Also it is a Beta-Version Track, indeed. o &#34; )
Sometimes it&#39;s a litle bit noisy and ear-damaging. - Or just not the exact, best result one would expect. Maybe more Versions to come.</info>
