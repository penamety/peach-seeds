 <info>From the author :
[quote]Finished it on Amiga Day as well, apparently. Appropriate, seeing as it&#39;s a remix of the Amiga classic &#34;Xenon&#34; - a stompin&#39; bit of high-energy game music which I&#39;ve transformed into some all-over-the-place madness. It was produced in Reason 7 and Ableton, and I named it &#34;Xoldin&#39; Out for a Xero&#34; in tribute to the classic Bonnie Tyler song of almost the same name (from which I took thunderclap inspiration).

Enjoy![/quote]
