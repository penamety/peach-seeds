 <info>This is a dubstep/chipmusic song made for the &#34;Weekly Treats&#34; series: 
[url]http://weeklytreats.net/album/29-yerzmyey-gasman[/url]

Here is a video from the concert version of the song: 
[yt]feOqOBTui5g[/yt] with live drums and synths.

Anyway, this song has been made on a pure ATARI TT, a machine released in 1990, with 4Mb of RAM, 8-bit sound quality, with 2 hardware digi-channels only.
The trick it - HexTracker gives 16 channels, using the Atari&#39;s 32Mhz Motorola CPU.
(Can make more but with a substantial sound quality reduction).

This song is a MOD format and has all its limitations (8 bit samples, only 64Kb for a sample, only 31 samples in the module, octaves limitation) but the only difference - are those 16 channels in the MOD (software mixing).

Recorded from real hardware (that originally has only 2 digi-channels, haha).</info>
