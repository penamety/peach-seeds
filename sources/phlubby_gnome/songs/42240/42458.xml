 <info>Lyrics:

I am in this maze
and everywhere I face
the walls are staring back at me,
hey
A road beyond the far
transcending passed the stars
unending through the dark above

So, while you’re waiting
for the wheel to come around…

Lost in time and space,
existence left no trace,
yet I’m aware and on my way
A fractured state of mind,
an instant trapped in time,
the shadow half of life deranged

So, while you’re waiting
for the wheel to come around
Smile to your maker
she’s somewhere, she’s around

    I gotta run to live, I wanna be alive
    I have a reason now, I wanna be alive

If i should ever find
a way I still don’t know
if I could trade my life away
Yet should I stay behind,
then you will never know
of all the wonders I have seen

So, while you’re waiting
for the wheel to come around
Smile to your maker
she’s somewhere, she’s around

    I gotta run to live, I wanna be alive
    I have a reason now, I wanna be alive
