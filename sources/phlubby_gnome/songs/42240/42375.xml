 <info>I originally had plans for another tune to submit to this compilation, but that didn&#39;t quite work out.
A few weeks ago a swedish band called &#39;Shallow Sense&#39; posted four songs they wanted to have remixed.
I then started playing around with the samples of one of those tracks, and pretty much in two-three days I made this.

The choirs are actually done using samples. A friend of mine; Slaygon, recorded about two octaves of &#34;aaaaaaaa&#34;.
I then edited his recordings and made them into a DirectWave preset. Then I copied about ten instances of it, and transposed each of them one note up.
This way, the choir sounds very &#34;full&#34; and nice. Initally, the goal was to make it sound like 10cc&#39;s choirs in their track &#34;I&#39;m not in love&#34;.

The acoustic guitar in the second half of the song were downloaded from a website with random guitar-samples. I changed the chords using Melodyne.
The vocals were also quite tweaked, along with the other guitar-samples.

In total I spent 12 hours in FL Studio and Melodyne.
I do think it has it&#39;s flaws, but hopefully someone will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it!</info>
