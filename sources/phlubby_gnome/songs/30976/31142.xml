&#34;I wrote this after my dog, Nugget, recovered from being terribly sick. Let&#39;s just say he ate a scrap of fabric and it ...didn&#39;t come out. After a couple of days he was in bad shape, dehydrated and in constant pain. Without emergency surgery, things didn&#39;t look good.

Well, as luck would have it, on the very morning that we were due to discuss said surgery, the problem resolved itself.
On his walk, in front of a bunch of little kids. &#34;Oh look a puppy, he is cute, what&#39;s his EWWWWWWWWWWW.&#34;

This is the music that was playing in my head as we joyfully skipped the whole way home. I transcribed it out of my head, for you to hear. It may or may not be the best music ever written to celebrate a dog crapping.&#34;</info>
