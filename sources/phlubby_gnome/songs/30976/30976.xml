 <info>&#34;Music for the Byterapers Reneissance demo is a mixture of outboard gear
and ITB orchestral libraries.  One of the outboard gear I used is my all
time favourite Studio Electronics ATC-X analogue monosynth which I ran
thru either Moogerfooger lowpassfilter, Frostwave Resonator (Low Pass
Filter) or Ibanez TS9DX distortion pedal.  I also used fully loaded Korg
Triton and it was used to the C64-like lead sounds and the electronic
drums you hear on the piece.  Tritons sounds were again processed thru
the filters mentioned.   Orchestral libraries I used were mostly Project
SAM brass/True Strike and for strings and woods I used Vienna Special
Edition Libraries.  The rest of the instruments (to double or to use
individually) were from the EWQLSO Platinum Library..  I used Protools
LE for midi editing and then the tracks were mixed our  studio (Protools
HD3 + outboard). (Watch out for the StereoVersion!!)   Nelli Nyman spoke
the text written by Grendel.  I think that this also adds a very nice
dimension to the demo..

I really wanted to combine the &#34;oldschool&#34; sound with some modern
classical elements to respect the old and to add something new.&#34;</info>
