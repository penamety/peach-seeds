Well this is yet 
another song in 
the orchestral style. 
This has the mighty 
drums of a war song 
and allso the very 
emotional Flute and 
Piano melodies. 
This is put together 
in to this tune. 
The sound is mighty 
and aswell sothing. 
A very good relax 
track if you ask me. 
I spend many hours 
on this track. 
So I hope you enjoy it
as much to listen to 
as I enjoyed making it
