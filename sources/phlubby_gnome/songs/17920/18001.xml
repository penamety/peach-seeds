 <info>Times when the morning is bright but cold
Whispers and shadows, the signs [...???]
The mystics and theories about to unfold

Reason&#39;s ahead of you
You&#39;ve heard it all before
You&#39;re not sure there is more
And love shall now prove it&#39;s true
Returning to the core
What you&#39;re searching for
Is there

There&#39;s no greater feeling; it is loosening my heart
I&#39;m turning into believing that [this right&#39;s?] about to start

Lost in the moment, in time unknown
Feels like eternal to be on your own
The mystics and theories should no longer hide, &#39;cause

Reason is there for you
Though you&#39;ve heard it all before
Can be sure there is more
And love will then prove it&#39;s true
Just hold onto the core
What you&#39;re searching for

Reason is there for you
Though you&#39;ve heard it all before
Can be sure there is more
And love will then prove it&#39;s true
Just hold onto the core
What you&#39;re searching for
Is there
