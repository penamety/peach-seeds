 <info>A Ballad for Diana&#34;. This track is a sad and romantic piece I composed for my girlfriend, who was about to return from her studies in Paris, where she spent 4 previous months.

The opening theme was a one-shot improvised idea, and after resting for a few weeks I went on and made this track in three nights.

That&#39;s about it, let the music tell the rest :)
