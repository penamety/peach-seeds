Lyrics:


I am spinning out of control
drinking my dark side on a moon patrol
Dropping an anchor on a concrete floor
the links are dragging me out of the door

Can I close my eyes and see?
Can I disappear and be?
Can I play the absentee,
In this cage I built for me?

Can I stand up where I fell?
Can I spiral in my shell?
Can I cast a binding spell,
On this winding road to hell?

I am spinning against the wall
grabbing on corners when I feel so small
give into impulse as I drop the ball
breaking the habits I cannot recall

Can I close my eyes and see?
Can I disappear and be?
Can I play the absentee,
In this cage I built for me?

Can I stand up where I fell?
Can I spiral in my shell?
Can I cast a binding spell,
On this winding road to hell?

I am spinning and the world is still
pointing the finger on the things I feel
you find me exhausted and crawling uphill
to colorful nightmares against my will


Can I close my eyes and see?
Can I disappear and be?
Can I play the absentee,
In this cage I built for me?

Can I stand up where I fell?
Can I spiral in my shell?
Can I cast a binding spell,
On this winding road to hell?

Can I burn my wings and fly?
Can I justify a lie?
Can I turn my back and cry?
can I be there when I die?</info>
