spaghetti maccaroni mortadella tortellini mozzarella stracciatella buona sera buona note

sei tutto per me
sono pazzo di te
entra nella mia vita
oh my pizza margherita

I still feel so high above
when I first saw you 
I fell deep in love
when I first saw you 
I had the proof
my feelings all went through the highest roof

the people around me 
they all see it too
because all I think and do is just for you

spaghetti maccaroni mortadella tortellini mozzarella stracciatella buona sera buona note

sei tutto per me
sono pazzo di te
entra nella mia vita
oh my pizza margherita

from the start you taste very good
I can&#39;t get enough of you
you are my favorite food
you are the best thing in the world
you have been built just for us NERDS
I can eat you every night and day
you are so awesome in every single way
