 <info>The track was made for Star Defender 3 game. It&#39;s interesting, that developer suggested to use such synthetic style instead of live-like pathetic guitar/orchestral style, which we used in previous issues of Star Defender game.
Believe it or not, &#34;Synthesed World&#34; disk and &#34;BrixOut XP&#34; game make such music style most wishful among russian shareware game developers :)</info>
