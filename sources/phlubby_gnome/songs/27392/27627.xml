 <info>Yeah, this is actually not a new song and it&#39;s been in for example Nectarine database for some time already. However, i suspect not many guys or girls have heard it and i thought it fits in this theme of aliens and so, put it in this musicdisk. History of this tune is rather peculiar again: i&#39;ve always loved this title (it&#39;s stolen from norwegian black metal one-man act Burzum!) and tried to dress the title as a song (it has absolutely nothing to do with Burzum&#39;s tune, as you can hear :)) with wandering past nebulas, quasars, black holes all the way to the unknown but beautiful harmonic, peaceful emptiness. Or something. Enough of that bullshit, time for some kind of greetinglist. Greetz to individuals or whole groups in (in no order): Nectarine folks, my Brainstorm goats, Bitfellas, Modarchive, AMP, modules.pl, SceneSat, pouet, Rebels, Orb, Andromeda, Alcatraz, Fairlight, Equinox(e), Traction, ISO, Jumalauta, Accession, Damones, Paradise, Neural, TRSI, SBD, Scoopex, Titan, Conspiracy, Dreamdealers, Rave Network Overscan and to the rest i forgot in this hangover :( Time to wraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap
