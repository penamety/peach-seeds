 <info>Inspired by Tangerine&#39;s tune from &#34;Synthesed World&#34; musicdisk, most samples taken from there as well. Jazzy piano solo is Lavender&#39;s trademark :)
The tune was made for another shareware game for Sunny Games. With this tune we send greets to all oldschool fans on ZX, Amiga and PC demoscene.</info>
