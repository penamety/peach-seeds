 <info>This time - romantic ballad. You know, I like celtic
music very much! Btw, the tune was planned as a Looker House
contribution to The Party 6, but Zinko//LKR, who had to bring
it there, didn&#39;t appear on irc in the right time, and seems
like that mail had not reached him! So I had to make a single
release on PeeCee (and that&#39;s not so bad :).</info>
