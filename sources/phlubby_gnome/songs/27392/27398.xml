 <info>In 1998 Proxium demogroup coded their own sound synthesizer. The next year they started a contest to choose a soundtrack for an upcoming 64 kb intro. I won the compo and the intro production has started. Only one 3D city scene was made till the 2000, when Proxium quite demoscene. So, in 2007 I contributed this track to 32 kb exe music compo on DiHalt. And I have won again :)</info>
