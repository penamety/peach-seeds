 <info>This tune was composed for the best pc-diskmag that
was made in Russia at this moment - &#34;Armor Of Gods&#34; issue 4.
16-bit version was released as a single after several requests
from people who wanted it. Warhawk asked me if I can write
something in &#34;Enigma&#34; style. I think this tune is not like
&#34;Enigma&#34; very much, but it is kinda mellow and trip-hoppish,
and it has very clean sound because of the samples.</info>
