 <info>Again a tune that looks like some fairy-tale music. Some
jazzy breaks in the middle, some hip-hop drums and very, very
high quality instruments (99% of sounds are 16bit). Melody may
seem a little &#34;cheesy&#34; but I like it anyway. It&#39;s a pity that
good sounds make it bigger. Btw, the song was written in four
days, and I spent around 20 hours making it.</info>
