 <info>This is my first released 4-channel MOD that was really
composed on Amiga (I bought an A600), while being on vacations
in the village with my girlfriend and grandma (my old Amiga
MODs were not released, and all the released ones were made
on PC using St3). This time I plugged my AMiGA to old russian 
black-and-white TV &#34;Oreol&#34; and tracked music in the deep deep 
night...That was so romantic! Style and sound are inspired by 
Mike Oldfield, let&#39;s call this a new age/rock tune.</info>
