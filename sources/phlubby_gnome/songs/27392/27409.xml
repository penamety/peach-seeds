Lyrics:
Winter is turning into spring
Who knows what the summer will bring?
Sunny beaches, oceans blue
I&#39;m with me and you&#39;re with you
But we need to go on
Like the earth in circles
Yeah we need to go on like the sun

Sky is crying while we weep
Are you waking when I sleep?

But we need to go on
Like the earth in circles
Yeah we need to go on like the sun
Like the sun
Like the sun
Like the sun
Like the sun</info>
