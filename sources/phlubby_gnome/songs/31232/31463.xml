 <info>Mine [Kanonmat] and Gustavs [LargerThanLink] second co-production.
Again we combined our different programs (Musagi and Sequel 2) to create this awesome piece of music.
When the song was finished i spent about the double time to add voice samples and master the sound. Good practice session!

Enjoy listening!
Stay nerdy :3</info>
