 <info>This track was done during a few days after the Christmas Eve of 2010 and finished on the 27th.

The aim was pretty much achieved: I wanted to imitate Michiel Van Der Kuy&#39;s sound from the 90s, as it is heard in the tracks he made for singers as well.

I heard a few of these 12&#34; singles countless times and tried to maintain the same style. I used contemporary synths and fiddled with the post-processing a lot.

I have lyrics prepared as well, hence the structure. A vocoder version will most probably follow, and, when the time comes, a female singer.

That&#39;s about it. Long live Michiel Van Der Kuy :)
