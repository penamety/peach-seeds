 <info>I had sent around a few of my unfinished tunes to a friend and he liked this one best. So I decided to finish it. Special thanx to: sPartanen, bauer, wiseman, mickrip, Jeroen Tel, BitArts

* Random alien invasion news reporter. He talks about Giant Crabs, so I decided to name the song after an E3 Meme. &#34;Hit the giant enemy crab on it&#39;s weak spot for massive damage&#34;. &#34;Based on famous japanese battles which took place&#34; (against giant crabs? :rofl: )</info>
