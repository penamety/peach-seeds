 <info>Boy has this song been lying around for a long time. This is one of the first songs I made for renoise. I&#39;ve never been quite happy with it. So now when I recently installed a few new vsti&#39;s I decided to finish it up. Once done the song had the same title as it had a year ago. &#34;New Template&#34;. So I sent the song to a few friends and asked if they could come up with a neat songname for me.	
Here&#39;s the results: &#34;Temple of ...&#34;, &#34;Contra Sidescroller Level from 1993&#34;, &#34;Nightscape Fencing&#34; So I decided to mash it up a bit, and well, yeah that&#39;s it. :)        
Thanx to: &#34;Tatsujin, cgmonkey &amp; Metal-Ridley&#34; for coming up with the name.        
Thanx to: &#34;overcoat&#34; for making me adjust some notes        
Oh and thanx to: maep, prowler &amp; fishboy876 for making this possible</info>
