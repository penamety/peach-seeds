 <info>I created this tune right after Interstellar Dissonance. Tried to create something different, but still consistent with the theme. I started composing this tune by experimenting with strings (that are in the beginning) which are then accompanied with various instruments that are heavily echoed. I think It gave this track mellow and spatial feeling.
