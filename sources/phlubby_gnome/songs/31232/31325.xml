 <info>This song is one of 6 house songs which i&#39;ve made for a Wii Fitness game.

For those who miss a melody or vocals,
the songs had to be drifty/impulsive but without
vocals or anything disrupting the vibe.

It&#39;s a Step game for people liking to step.
vocals and all are being added by the game
developers themself. the stuff like &#34;and up and down and up and down .. now left, now left..&#34; blabla ;)
