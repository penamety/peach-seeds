 <info>This tune was partly inspired by the title tune of a relatively old PC game called &#34;My Teacher is an Alien&#34;. It was made with FL Studio 9, mostly using Audjoo Helix which is a fantastic VST. I tried to do it in a sort of 80&#39;s style, as a sort of cartoon intro tune or something like that.</info>
