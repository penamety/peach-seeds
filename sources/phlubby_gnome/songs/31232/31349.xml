 <info>Greetings to all Nectarine regulars. The Nectarine compos, and projects like this one, are very inspiring. It has turned out to be a great arena for newcomers - as well as oldtimers. It is really great to see how the quality has improved over the last couple of years.
Thanks to maep, prowler and Fishguy876 for supporting us musicians.
Special greeting to Yes, the true father of Nectarine. See you soon, mate!</info>
