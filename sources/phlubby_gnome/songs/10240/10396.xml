&#34;his mouth filled with an aching taste of blue.. his eyes were unstable crystal, vibrating with a frequency whose name was rain and the sound of trains, suddenly
sprouting a humming forest of hair-fine
glass splines. the splines split again, bisected, split again, exponential growth...

and he was remembering an ancient story, a king placing coins on a chessboard, doubling the amount at each
square.. exponential... darkness fell in from every side, a sphere of singing black, pressure on the extended crystal nerves of the universe of data he had nearly
become.... and when he was nothing,
compressed at the heart of all that dark, there came a point where the dark could be no more, and something tore... &#34;
