Lyrics:
Flush, so baby the game is mine this time
So take off your clothes baby for me
Fortuna is blind, maybe next time
You&#39;ll get a chance

I&#39;ve known it from the start
It&#39;s a game you cannot win
Baby it&#39;s your turn
It&#39;s your job
And you&#39;ve given all you can
Baby, this is me
I&#39;m the man
And I play the cards my way
No escape
Not for you
Not for anyone

( [???] hits the floor. Pants are all that&#39;s left)

Flush, so baby the game is mine this time
So take off your clothes baby for me
Fortuna is blind, maybe next time
You&#39;ll get a chance
Come, try again

(Game is mine...) x2

And if the time is right
You better give your blinds to me
You know you have to lose
In the end
And your pants are all that&#39;s left
This time it is me
I&#39;m your man
And I play it from my heart
No escape
Not for you
Not for anyone

( [???] hits the floor. Pants are all that&#39;s left)

Flush, so baby the game is mine this time
So take off your clothes baby for me
Fortuna is blind, maybe next time
You&#39;ll get a chance
Come, try again

Flush, so baby the game is mine this time
So take off your clothes baby for me
Fortuna is blind, maybe next time
You&#39;ll get a chance x2

Come try again</info>
