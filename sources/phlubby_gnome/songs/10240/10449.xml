 <info>That girl, that beautiful lady in the corner. How I wish she will speak to me. How I wish we will make eye contact. How I wish we can dance through the night. Wouldn&#39;t it be exciting  if she speaks to me?

This 16 tracks module started off with a &#34;classical styled&#34; beginning, describing the period of fantasy and hesitation, the period of &#34;no action&#34;. Then, &#34;She speaks to me&#34; and the connection was made. It then led to a ballad with carefully arranged climax and melody that sought to reflect the dancing session, so smoothing and enchanting. The exciting experience will only be justified if concluded with an jazzy finishing.
