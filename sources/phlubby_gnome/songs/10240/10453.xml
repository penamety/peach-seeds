 <info>Darkness and tranquility dominates the hours of pre-dawn, until the first ray of light, the first dim glow, would come, and melt a hole in the afar.
The sun then softly rises, gently knocking on your dreams, bringing with it the fire of life and the whisper of hopes.
It&#39;s a brand new day, with much to accomplish.
It&#39;s everyone&#39;s turn to give, in any way.
Even knowing that somebody else breath easier because you live, is a valuable accomplishment.</info>
