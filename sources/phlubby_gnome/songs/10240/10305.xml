Lyrics:
They try to beat me
but they will not ever defeat me
This time we&#39;re on my battlegrounds
I&#39;m gonna win, trust in me
I have come to save this world
and in the end I&#39;ll get the girl!

I&#39;ve missed it, so twisted
and unsurpassed in my head
This sense of power has awakened in me
I feel I could take on the world
a day like this
my rage is brewing like a storm

And now the storm has grown
out of control
Right here, the voice of anger
taking tone
Cause now the fire
in our hearts explode
Baby, let&#39;s blow this joint
and build our own

Sometimes you just need to
level everything with the ground to
make room for all the things
you wanted somehow
And I have known it all along
the day is coming
when you will reap your evil ways</info>
