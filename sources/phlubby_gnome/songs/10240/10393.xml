anyways this tune almost disappeared when my disk got corrupted but luckily i found it again on ior&#39;s hard drive ;)
greets to elric of elektroflux for letting me track this stupid song on his computer and also to the people in the invasion crew
them being ior, siren, khyron, and me ;)
greets to melLow-D for letting me use his
computer to rewrite this dumb sample text :)
