 <info>Lyrics:
I&#39;ve been around, I&#39;ve been a player
I&#39;ve seen the world
through the eyes of a slayer
So many lives, so many places
I have been since the first time I tasted

true dreams of fiction
pure rush and adrenal addiction
but now I fear
that the magic was killed by corruption

I wanna feel like that again
I wanna be a hero all over again
You&#39;re on my side or in my way
I&#39;ll blast you all to nothing anyway

Another day, another trial
another month of this endless denial
but now I sense

I wanna be unbound by science
one world, under me
somewhere undirected and free
one place, unseen
uncorrupted creativity

I wanna feel like that again
I wanna be a hero all over again
You&#39;re on my side or in my way
I&#39;ll blast you all to kingdom come</info>
