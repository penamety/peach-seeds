 <info>&#34;regarding Sauron - those sample have all been ripped from RSI-Rise Up. But a few of them I already ripped from Huelsbeck&#39;s R-Type Main theme

the drums are from &#34;Word Up&#34; originally

I never would have made a tune that uses exact the same samp,le set like another tune by myself :D&#34; - Romeo Knight</info>
