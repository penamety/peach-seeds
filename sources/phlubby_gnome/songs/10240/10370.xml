composed by Purple Motion / FC
remixed by Omega / Diversion


so guys, this one is my tribution to FC...

this song was made the day after necros and a few others released their musicdisk with several remixed songs from FC

it&#39;s a pitty that they didn&#39;t tell me about
it :)

most samples are from the original (pm)
the rest are from me.

Greets to all i meet everyday at #trax
