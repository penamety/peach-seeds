 <info>This short cutting is for the f-MRT (bloodstream in the brain) Study called &#34;schizophrenic behavior&#34;. [...] 
You see pictures of a man showing you simple gestics and you have two knops. Is the man doing the right gestics? Well, overally. yes. Only one knop.

80 euro with psychological test.
50euro without.Takes 3/4 hour.

Study is done.

*puke*

f-MRT is a big, very expensive Magnetresonancetormograph which is medicinally used.

I did that track before the study, because i go sometimes for a money to it.
It has many glasfibers and is heavy loud. :-)

I do not believe that there are much results with f-mrt and even with a modern Computertormograph.

But for a payed checkup it&#39;s good, because of they can see the blood flow.

So they called me. I only see my brain on the CD and in the laboratory there, too. Only a few brains.</info>
