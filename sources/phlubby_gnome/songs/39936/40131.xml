 <info>&#34;Convalescence&#34; - Pop/Ambient - 8:33

This was my debut track for my netlabel hellven. Written and produced in 2 days, this is the first track of mine featuring singing. I wish the vocals were produced better but unfortunately I was facing hardware problems at the time! This track was warmly received by our listeners though, and I&#39;m satisfied with it, even though it&#39;s much more &#34;Pop&#34; oriented than what I would normally do.</info>
