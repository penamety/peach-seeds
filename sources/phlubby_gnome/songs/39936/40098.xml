 <info>Music composed with Fast Tracker II in the later &#39;90. 
Source was lost, however the track was 
recorded into a tape so it was reversed into digital format.
Guitar&#39;s samples were recorded by me, while some audio clips (the beginning and the ending parts) are taken from Alone in the dark (1992) CD</info>
