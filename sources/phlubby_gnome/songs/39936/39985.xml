 <info>Originally done in 2013 but released in a demo in 2014.

(Will be) used in documentary film by British filmmakers Anthony Caulfield and Nicola Caulfield that tells the story of the British video games industry from 1979 to the present day.

From Bedrooms to Billions is scheduled for release in May 2014.

&#34;Rob wrote the music, and was sat next to me when we did the SID version, so is by myself and Rob hubbard. Hope that clarifies the point. Rob obviously has not got his source code and assemblers etc, so needed help in making the SID.&#34;
