Made entirely using Ableton 6, A handful of vsti&#39;s (mainly the massive and the sylenth1), some old ragga calls I had lying about on my hard drive and the usual cut up drum loops and a fair few crates of beer and cigarettes. 

Done simply because its the sort of music I grew up with and its the sort of music I started out writing and always find myself drawn too and in the &#34;scene&#34; pretty much what im best known for.

Shouts to everyone at scene sat, remix 64, retro remakes, alex aris, ovine, retrospec, psytronik, all the spanish remakers ive worked with who&#39;s names are too numerous and well.. spanish for my pathetic english brain to remember (but they know who they are), my friends on facebook, anyone thats a fan, my twitter buddies, dan franklin, bassline junkie, anyone who has ever supported the scene, and even those that don&#39;t and my mum .. just because she&#39;s my mum.
