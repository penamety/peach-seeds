------------------
lyrics goes somewhat like this:

Je je jeeeeee x 4

I put an entry for introcompo
And wrote a wish with it
If it could be possible in any way
That the gfx-card would be Nvidia

Well what happened
Compo started and ended and my intro wasn&#39;t shown
Unfortunately it happened
This time compo machine had

Ati Ati Ati Ati &#34;Yeeessh&#34;
AMD AMD AMD AMD &#34;Yessssh&#34; x2

OK, let&#39;s try to forget all the sad things and play a major chord at this point
Good, now I&#39;m having a good mood again [:D]
