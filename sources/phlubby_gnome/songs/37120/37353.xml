 <info>Text from an Atari-Forum.com forum post by YERZMYEY:

&#34;Last times I was testing how Atari 520ST would behave as a synthesizer in recording studio.

What I mean is - in early 70s synthesizers sounded in similar way to later sound-chips, they had rather simple possibilities - it was recording-studio effects what gave the special sound to early electronic music actually, not entirely the synthesizers by themselves, in fact.

So - I recorded all the required sequencies (with MusicMon) track by track, I added loads of studio effects and... ;)

The only instrument/sound-source and sequencer is Atari 520ST.

Of course ***HEAVY POST-PRODUCTION*** has been added, to change sound of original sequences totally. Recording studio effects used: track-by-track recording / filters / phasers / choruses / flangers / delays / echoes / reverbs / equalizers / compressors / limiters.

It shows what Atari micromusic hardware can be used to :)

Data of post-production:

Hardware:
- Behringer FEX 800
- Behringer XENYX 1002 FX
- ZOOM RFX 2000

Software:
- Sony SoundForge 8.0
- CoolEdit Pro 2.1&#34;
