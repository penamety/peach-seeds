 <info>Lyrics:
Music is my passion
The only thing I feel
It’s really like an obsession and
Don’t think I’m not for real

And every time that I sing a song
I become a new woman
I’m not mad so don’t get me wrong
It’s only that I...

Cannot stop until I’m there
And I know music helps me when I’m feeling bare
I’m walking straight into the light
I’m heading for the other side

Sometimes I’m a depressive
When everything goes wrong
When hassle turns me aggressive then
I have to sing a song

At once the troubles just fade away
And I become a new woman
Sounds pretty easy but it’s that way
It’s really that I...

Cannot stop until I’m there
And I know music helps me when I’m feeling bare
I’m walking straight into the light
I’m heading for the other side

So let the music take your heart
Good music is a thing apart
I’ll sing and dance for my whole life
And I enjoy my life
I Enjoy my life
