 <info>Lyrics:
30 feet, 2-1/2 down.
Faint shadow
4 forward, 4 forward, drifting to the right a little.
Okay
30 seconds
Hold
Contact light. OK engines stop.
Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.
Roger Tranquillity.
We copy you on the ground.
You&#39;ve got a bunch of guys about to turn blue.
We&#39;re breathing again. Thanks a lot.

The fading day will hide the pain
And knowing you will break the chain
As time slows down, the hour draws near
We conspire to make it clear

You&#39;ll never find a better time
to make a stand; You&#39;ll be fine
Know the game and all it holds
Just watch it now as it unfolds</info>
