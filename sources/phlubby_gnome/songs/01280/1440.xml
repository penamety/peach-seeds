i m walking in my mind
you re walking by my side
living in my personal world
but you re agree with this rules

show me love and how make it grow
show me all the moves n all the laws
but now i know love is so braitly
n you re agree with this rules



stories of love
have no chance to live
in a such world of
fear n anxiety

stories of love
one day be dead
rip in my heart
my soul as a fingertip

inocence you beleive in love
but life will change ur mind
behind skin of beauty swine was hide
n you re agree with this rules


speaking and i i would like to tell you i m falling in love
but i m not sure that you will ready for this
how can i explain such feeling
cloose to a wolrd who had lost the love
