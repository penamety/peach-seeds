 <info>I couldn’t wait anymore
I couldn’t stay here or…
I ‘ll begin to drop
Begin to give up my job

I couldn’t wait this day
I couldn’t stay in my chair
i’ll begin to…

Well here is probably one of my favorite track from year 1997 that still sounds great many years later ! Sceners should probably recognise an important inspiration from the track written by [artist]432[/artist] for the Demo [song]2492[/song] realised by Pulse for the Gravity 97. Anyway this a new track, using the same sample set. I was realy fed of waiting and waiting again long weeks before i will be able to see back Delphine. Why had I go so far, in Louvain-La-Neuve, far for my friends and girlfriend….
