 <info>Attention, if you are used to fly without logical reason, you should not listen to this track, in case you should never come back on earth…

I was inspirated from the track 1.000.000 miles from Ronny/Teklords found in the PC FUN, and then started this track mixing Dream Music, Vangelis, Moby, with a tripoïd intro, hardcore bassdrum and great SoundFX…

So Ciao Amigo, i go back to preparing my cases to go to Louvain-La-Neuve… Hope there I could continue writing music, but for now, no computer was planned.

The CD version included in Esperenza’s album finished with a special vocal : We go on a Trip to Stratos !
