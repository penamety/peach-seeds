<p>Lyrics<br />---<br />[First Verse]</p>

<p>Listen up kid, it’s time to put down the Wiimote<br />Drop the 32-bits, hop into my boat<br />Talkin’ trash like a punk emcee,<br />I’ll punch you in the face like the Ninja from Bruce Lee!</p>

<p>My kid is the son of an 8 bit,<br />In front of a sixty-four’s where I sit.<br />I like to battle, but I won’t bark on,<br />I’ll toast your ass like the Phoenix from Archon.</p>

<p>I’m great at a million games man,<br />When you were in diapers, I was cleanin up Wasteland.<br />Summer Games, Winter Games, World Games, too,<br />California Games cured my summertime Blues</p>

<p>Wanna play? Bring a DB9 Stick,<br />I got an old Epyx that I’ll kick your ass with.<br />You want mercy? Well you better start wishin,<br />You beatin’ me’s an Impossible Mission.</p>

<p>Like HERO, I’m about to fly,<br />With a disk notcher I’ll use your backside,<br />Like Load Runner you’ll drop your load,<br />Then I’ll pick up your package of gold.</p>

<p>You’re a headbanger, cuz you bang your drive’s head<br />You’re like a zombie, and you’re already dead,<br />And I’m a serial killer with a serial cable,<br />Cuz you’re retarded, or should I say disabled?</p>

<p>Let’s play Pitfall, you know what to do?<br />Well take notes chump and I’ll give you a clue.<br />Jump over the logs, then swing on the vines,<br />And then you gotta UH OH out of time!</p>

<p>This battle’s over, I’ve already won,<br />Cuz you come last like comma eight comma one.<br />Feelin’ lucky? Wanna test your ability?<br />You beatin’ me? Realm of Impossibility.</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>I’m the king of [the Commodore]<br />You don’t want none of [the Commodore]<br />You can’t handle [the Commodore]</p>

<p>[Second Verse]</p>

<p>So bring what you got, whatchu think, you’re bad man?<br />Well I got skills yo, but I ain’t Rad Man<br />Cuz he does art, yo and I play games, yo<br />so pick up a stick and I’ll bring the pain, yo</p>

<p>Cuz here is the church and here is the steeple,<br />your only friends are Little Computer People<br />In Skate or Die you always fall,<br />So you can suck on my Wizballs</p>

<p>I’ll cut your head off, like Barbarian<br />I’m bout to school you like a librarian<br />Your expectations are never gonna be met<br />I’ll rip you apart like Racing Destruction Set</p>

<p>You think your bad, you better get your facts on,<br />Cuz I can rock a perfect score in Zaxxon,<br />Wanna play some Hacker or Hacker II,<br />Well look it up bitch I wrote the walk thru.</p>

<p>Your face is red, I can tell your pissed,<br />Cuz I whipped you in the Way of the Exploding Fist<br />Cuz I kick ass, and I never come in last,<br />And I’ll beat your ass at Boulderdash</p>

<p>Player one, player two, it just don’t matter,<br />In Karate Champ your face will splatter,<br />I’ll whip you, like a goddess wearing leather<br />You can Stay a while, but don’t stay forever.</p>

<p>In Beach Head you took two the dome,<br />You gonna need a Space Taxi to get you home.<br />Yes I’m better than you, you’re not just paranoid,<br />and I’m a 999 in Paradroid</p>

<p>Three minutes and this track is through<br />I’m number one and you’re 6502<br />We’re done here, and there’s the door,<br />I was right, you can’t handle the Commodore.</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>[Closing Comments]</p>

<p>That’s right, he’s the king.<br />You better run/stop your mouth.<br />Aw your disk is all floppy …<br />He’s got two kids — Vic, and Sid.<br />He’s gonna get you with an Isepic.<br />Yeah, you can’t handle the Commodore …</p></i>

		<p>&#34;I sent copies of the song out to half a dozen friends and the majority of them said, “it’s not as bad as I was expecting.” Based on their feedback I lowered the volume of the modem tone, EQ’ed the voice on the second track a little lower, and added the “end comments” which in the end I didn’t like, but it sounded better than having nothing there.</p>

<p>Blockparty had 15 song entries, and mine was number 14th in line to be played. As the organizers began playing the songs, I noticed something — none of them had any lyrics! They all sounded computer generated, and none of them were “songs” like I was thinking. I slumped further in my seat. I had misjudged the style of music completely. My only hope was that the crowd would be full of C64 fans and that they would like my jokes.</p>

<p>Well, they didn’t, at least not very much. I tied for seventh place out of fifteen songs which put me right in the middle. To be honest, after hearing the quality and style of the other entries I expected to be closer to the bottom of the list. While I’m not exactly proud of where I placed, I’m glad I entered and, if nothing else, forced a room full of a couple hundred nerds to listen to me rap. It’s a trauma I’m sure it will take some time for them to get over.&#34;</p>
