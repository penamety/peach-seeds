 <info>ZX Spectrum 48K with AY-interface. Italo-disco - good music for summer. 

3 digital channels in 4-bit quality. I must admit I even like this one, as it&#39;s interesting impression to hear such a sound from a computer in size of a bigger calculator. 

Soft used: SAMPLE-TRACKER. There is only about 34Kb for entire &#34;MOD&#34; song. Well, it&#39;s not a real MOD, as it has only 3 channels and also it has no volume-commands. To trick it, I made most of samples in two versions - louder and more silent, to achieve delays. Of course it took much more RAM, so I had to make the samples even more carefully. AY/YM chip isn&#39;t in fact supposed to play samples, so the procedure is based on CPU mostly. I managed here to make an impression of 4 channels by putting samples very nifty. 

&#34;Kaminari&#34; comes from Japanese language and it means &#34;thunder&#34;. 

Recorded from real hardware.</info>
