 <info>Mainly used beer to create this track.
[artist]wiseman[/artist] was involved and so was my big brother.

[b]VERSE 1:[/b]
Screw this. I&#39;m leavin&#39; town. I&#39;m gonna miss the parties around. Oh-woa-ow
We had the best times of our lives. 
Even when Lukelove was p-p-playing 

Remember that strange weird tune going: 
&#34;Indi indi indi indi indi indian&#34;
Or the time when we danced to some weird finnish demo songs
This is our tribute song to, the scene

[b]BRIDGE:[/b]
Nectarine... Forever
Nectarine... don&#39;t GO
Nectarine... Forever
Nectarine.. OH -beep- GO!

[b]CHORUS:[/b]
Open  your beer, we&#39;re gonna demo party...
Boozing all night, until we&#39;ve won the compo...
Pour up your beer, in the heat of the sauna...
Boozing all night, until the sun has set.

[b]VERSE 2:[/b]
-beep-ed up, I went out for a smoke, 
Looked up at the stars, felt the breeze of the cars.
a Girl in her top, with her long-legs she rocks.
I can feel the urge I&#39;m not one of the nerds.
Seven~eight cold, I started to mumble
jumbo mumbo, just believed that I&#39;m Rambo.
Holding this gun, locked and loaded
I&#39;m feeling mighty, mighty tighty 
Remember that strange tune going woa oh, uh   oh oh
