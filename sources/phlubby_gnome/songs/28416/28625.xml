Lyrics:

Sooner or later it&#39;s all

Sooner or later it floats

Sooner or later it breaks

Sooner or later it&#39;s all in the past 



How happy we are today 

The feeling will only escape 

No matter who we blame it on 

When the thrill is gone, it&#39;s gone, it&#39;s gone 

This could be the best we got 

And what we got is on our hands 

Are you going to the countdown? 



Sooner or later it&#39;s all in the past 

Sooner or later it floats above the glass 

Sooner or later it breaks inside the cast 

Sooner or later



Concrete rubble for concrete dreams 

Grains of sand floating in the sea 

Passing trains, all the passing trees 

Can you heed the whistle please?



Sooner or later it&#39;s all in the past 

Sooner or later it floats above the glass 

Sooner or later it breaks inside the cast 

Sooner or later</info>
