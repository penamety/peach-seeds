-------------------------------------------------
Comic Bakery, a song i always wanted to remix. But i wanted to remix it in a way not done before.

Had a couple of ideas on how it should sounds. Some better and some worse.

Anyway it ended up as it is now.

Morpheus recorded some nice drums that where supposed to be in the song after the break in the end. But sadly they didn&#39;t fit into the song. The song was to much &#34;electro&#34; to use real drums in.
So the solution was to put them after Hanna&#39;s laugh where the song was pitched up and down.

Also want to say thank you to those who helped me along the way. Not going to mention any names.. You know who you are.</info>
