 <info>Second at BreakPoint 2010 - Unofficial tracked music

Info:
Finished in 2009, prepared to release in on 25.02.2010 for BreakPoint 2010 tracked music compo.

This tune has been written for a demo which, unfortunately, has been cancelled :(

...but thanks to that I now have something to put into compo :)

I&#39;ve been inspired by a lot of demo tunes while making it especially White Room tune by Chromag, LittleBitchard&#39;s music and some of X-Ceed&#39;s stuff.

In order to fit in compo rules I had to downgrade some samples and cut the intro a bit.
Well, not a big loss I guess :)</info>
