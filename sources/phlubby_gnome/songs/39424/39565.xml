 <rating votes="22">4.1818</rating>
 <info>This tune is by Markus Schneider but has for quite some time appeared incorrectly in HVSC under Thomas Detert.

The remix excludes the first part of the original SID and instead concentrates on the main theme.

The human beat box was done by yours truly to add a fresh element to the remix.

Technical notes
The remix was done using Logic Audio Platinum 6.x and a variety of software and hardware instruments including EMU E4XT sampler, Yamaha CS6R, Roland JV-2080, Emagic ES2, Clavia Nord Rack 2, and more. Mixed in Logic Audio and on the VM7200 digital console. Mastered with T-RackS24.</info>
