 <info>My first song for Nerve. I just joined Nerve artgroup. Also the second song on my new album &#34;Broken.&#34; &#34;Saturation (Part I)&#34; was the first song on the album.

This song is a shortened version of my upcoming song, Finding Myself. Look out for it, but I may never release a new version of this song. Hope you like this one!</info>
