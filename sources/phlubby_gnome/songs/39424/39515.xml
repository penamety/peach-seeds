lyrics (more or less)

we&#39;ve got the power
we&#39;ve got ambition
we&#39;ve got the wisdom
we&#39;ve got the mission



we&#39;ve got the demolition
we&#39;ve got the ammunition
we&#39;ve got the exposition
we&#39;ve got the superstition


we&#39;re on the highway to win
we&#39;re on the highway to win


we&#39;ve got the intuition
we&#39;ve got no competition
we&#39;ve got no intermission
we&#39;ve got are composition

we&#39;re on a run to win</info>
