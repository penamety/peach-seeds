 <info>The original idea/outline of the work and the instruments were made by SuperNoise.
Then I joined in :) I compressed Supernoise&#39;s 5 minutes into 2 minutes, re-arranged everything, reworked drums, piano.

Then I added a dubstep interlude ;D

The worst thing was to come up with the outro - I lacked ideas.
That&#39;s why it is IMO the weakest part of the song.
