 <info>#bermuda triangle#
presents
a tune to the very
nicest person Minthy!
made especially for
her :)

greets to all the peo-
ple giving their best
friendship to this
wonderful person :))


notice: the refrain is
an almost total ripoff
of Erasure. The smp-
set was taken directly
from the tune:
&#34;She Came To Me&#34;

Pleez, don&#39;t spread
this tune! :)
