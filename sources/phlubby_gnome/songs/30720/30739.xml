 <info>ull name (due to 8bc&#39;s uploader acting like a complete butt on japanese characters): 「お兄ちゃんだからいいよ〜♪ (&#39;Pheromone OVERDOSAGE Mix&#39; part)」. part of an ongoing pastiche-remix series based on a particular older tune i&#39;ve made. fairly simplistic electro house wankoff loop (topped with atrociously repetitive chord progression &amp; fake autotune awfulness), conceived &amp; made in a complete rush during a wednesday morning -- which was originally intended for a live set later on that day. plain vanilla nes 2a03-only.
