If you like my music or would just like to say &#34;hi&#34;, write me
at sxenos@chat.carleton.ca or sxenos@usa.net. If you&#39;re a tracker,
I&#39;m always interested in talking tunes and exchanging techniques.
I&#39;m usually available for doing game or demo music. In other news, Hyper
BBS has closed down, so you can no longer pick up my music there. I&#39;m
looking for a new way of getting my tunes distributed. If you know of any
effective, free way of distributing music over the internet, I want to
know about it.

Mauricio: If you&#39;re reading this, e-mail me now! I can&#39;t remember how to
get ahold of you.
