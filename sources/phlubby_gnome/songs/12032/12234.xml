This is *NOT* AY!
This is a chiptune with sound-quality of ONE BIT (sound turn-on, sound turn-off, nothing more). Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer.

Author&#39;s note: &#34;This song has been inspired by famous ZX Spectrum game&#39;s music: &#34;AnoGaia&#34; by Andy Mills. It&#39;s title is: &#34;File Not Found&#34;. :) For intro I used ALBERT EINSTEIN DRUMS (one-bit drum-machine) and for main part of music I used 3-Channel Synthesiser.&#34;
