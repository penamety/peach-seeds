This is *NOT* AY!
This is a chiptune with sound-quality of ONE BIT (sound turn-on, sound turn-off, nothing more). Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer.

Author&#39;s note: &#34;This time I used Drum Machine (a 1-bit and 1-channel program that is able to generate various drum-like noices and put them into its on-board sequencer) and The Music Studio to make main part of the music. Once again I made some experiments with delay and I surmounted one bit limitations again - the cool delay works. ;) Enjoy the song!&#34;
