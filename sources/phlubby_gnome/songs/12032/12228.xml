This is *NOT* AY!
This is a chiptune with sound-quality of ONE BIT (sound turn-on, sound turn-off, nothing more). Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer.

Author&#39;s note: &#34;3 channels (including drums). This time I used again Orfeus Music Assembler and also made a small routine in BASIC (with BEEP commands). As Orfeus has some envelopes (not editable â€˜though) I made attempt to do a delay effect in 1-bit music. Sounds pretty cool. &#34;
