This is *NOT* AY!
This is a chiptune with sound-quality of ONE BIT (sound turn-on, sound turn-off, nothing more). Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer.

Author&#39;s note: &#34;The song is 2-channels (including poor drums) BEEPER composition, made on The Music Studio editor, on Timex 48Kb.&#34;
