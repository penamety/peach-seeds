This is *NOT* AY!
This is a chiptune with sound-quality of ONE BIT (sound turn-on, sound turn-off, nothing more). Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer.

Author&#39;s note: &#34;Orig. by DANKO (Amiga 500). This is 1-bit version of the famous MOD song. :) Editors/Processors used in the song: The Music Box, The Music Studio, Orfeus Music Assembler. All mixed to one song in a play-routine made in BASIC. :)&#34;
