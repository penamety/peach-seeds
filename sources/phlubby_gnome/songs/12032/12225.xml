This is *NOT* AY! 
This is a chiptune with sound-quality of ONE BIT (sound turn-on, sound turn-off, nothing more). Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer.

Author: &#34;A song dedicated to Pinokio/Tristesse (Atari XL/XE), as he loves this engine (which is ZX-7 Polyphonic Musical Instrument but this time I used only 5 channels). A sample on the beginning is made with Sampler program. Anyway - enjoy!&#34;</info>
