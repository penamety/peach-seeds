wheeeeeeeee!!! lug00ber here, churning out some words for you to read while listening to our remix. We&#39;ve been working on this for about four months now, interrupted by both me and OptmizE moving to new apartments. We both love the original track, and it has been fun (and a bit frustrating at times) to do a rework of it. Not really in the mood for writing a long text now, so here are some greetings: In no particular order we greet our friends in Kvasigen, Spaceballs, Portal Process, Outracks, ODD, ASD (navis, you rule!) Hullkort Masters, Playpsyco, IFB, INF, Excess, Creators, Ephidrena, Contraz and some other norwegian groups we probably forgot. Special greetings go to all ex-TSL members and to Gloom, Concrete, lf0dd &amp; mc vocOdd, Irvin, Kusma, Leia, Flipside and keith303 (nice to see that you like our tracks!) -- Laziness rules, let&#39;s wrap in 10 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 0 .................</info>
