This is *NOT* AY!
This is a chiptune with sound-quality of ONE BIT (sound turn-on, sound turn-off, nothing more). Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer.

Author&#39;s note: &#34;3 channels music and 1-bit sample! Soft used: Orfeus Music Assembler and Sampler. Hardware â€“ as usual.&#34;
