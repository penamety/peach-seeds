This is *NOT* AY!
This is a chiptune with sound-quality of ONE BIT (sound turn-on, sound turn-off, nothing more). Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer.

Author&#39;s note: &#34;The song has been made using Timex 48Kb computer with its 1-bit sound system (which stands for BEEPER :) ). Software used: The Music Studio and Sintetizador De Voz. Two channels.&#34;
