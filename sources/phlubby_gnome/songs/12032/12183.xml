Lyrics:
I would like to sway you
to be happy here today
I Love You Song&#39;s too cheesy
It just is not that easy

What if we made some love
Would that help, sort of?
Despite all that you had
sometimes you seem too sad.

I hope you are believing
There is no sense in grieving
There is no use in sighing
There is comfort in crying

I hope you are believing
in the life that you are weaving
There is a point in trying
cause one day you&#39;ll be flying

I have tried to wake you
for new frontiers to take you to
And you tried heavy working
to escape your shadows, lurking

Think of all the journeys we had
Think of alll the times you got mad
Would living seem so dull and bland?
I will always hold your hand...</info>
