This is *NOT* AY!
This is a chiptune with sound-quality of ONE BIT (sound turn-on, sound turn-off, nothing more). Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer.

Author&#39;s note: &#34;Believe or not: real ONE BIT SAMPLES, real digital music from BEEPER!!! MOD for BEEPER? Almost. :) You can find here 3 digital channels of 1-bit music. Program SAMPLE-TRACKER requires only 48Kb of RAM and... BEEPER of course. :) So you can make MOD-like songs for your hardcore configuration!!! ;) Hardware: Timex Computer 48Kb of course.&#34;
