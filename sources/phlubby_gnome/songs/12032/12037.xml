Here&#39;s a good one for you, it&#39;s sounds so realistic!
I sampled and played that cool guitar riff myself, using a Shure SM/57 with a Fender Acoustic 12Strings.
Thanks to the author of JIMI.MOD for those GREAT Hammond Sounds!  Drums are by me too...  It&#39;s groovy, it&#39;s cool.
I&#39;ll drink the milk of paradise... I&#39;ve heard the wisper tales of immortality. Time and man alone, XANADU.
Later Guyz.   (Like Vizz)
