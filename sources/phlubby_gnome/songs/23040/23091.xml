 <info>&#34;It was actually composed for my friends 30th birthday. He hates techno and that Tuohitorvi (horn instrument). So of course I had to make a song out of those two elements. We were on a boat and one of the guys had that tuohitorvi with him and they played it (and guitar) couple of days straight. So it&#39;s really done in 10 minutes and it&#39;s a joke :)&#34; -PM</info>
