 <info>    &#34;Wish of Freedom&#34;
Parity Error
done for the Analogue
chip contest
I&#39;m not a chip artist,
but I gave it my best to
make these samples sound
some-what smooth..

If it weren&#39;t for the 
instrumental effects of
IT, I would be here for
at least another 4-5 more
hours working on this
tune.. don&#39;t you just luv
that Xylophone?
One of my more repetative
and non-straying songs,
my goal here was to
produce a song with
good
order, and good melody
changes; I hope it shows.

I had fun with the solos,
as you can see, hope it
doesn&#39;t crowd the song.
