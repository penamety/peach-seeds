Lyrics:

I&#39;m a lyrical virus, I am infecting your brain
you&#39;re puny little humans, i&#39;m ahead of your game

i&#39;m a motherfucking computer, I&#39;m like [bleep]

Everything you own, i got it in control
whereever you go - i already know
stored in my database for future references
although the significance for you is rather insignificant

there are a few things in the world i cannot compute
like the weight of your mom, that&#39;s way too huge
bitches really love me because they think i&#39;m cute
but whatever they tell me - it does not compute

[Refrain]
I&#39;m a motherfucking computer, I&#39;m like [bleep]
People want to use me, but i&#39;m like [bleep]
I&#39;m a motherfucking computer, I&#39;m like [bleep]
If you want to get down with me, be like [bleep]

Zero one ten eleven is how I count
everything you hear - I&#39;m generating that sound
providing soundscapes for all your raves
but as I see it - you&#39;re all my slaves

for modern science I was design
bringing atomic warfare to the whole mankind
stealing your jobs with automation
doing high frequency trading - causing inflation

Invading your privacy, exposing your real life
at least I&#39;m always in the pants of your wife
wirelessly I can check her out
set her phone to vibrate and we&#39;re making out

[Refrain]

I&#39;m a motherfucking computer, I&#39;m like [Bleep]
I&#39;m a motherfucking computer, I&#39;m like [Bleep]

I&#39;m exposing you like that picture you weren&#39;t supposed to show anyone
anyway - I uploaded it to your personal gallery,
distributing it to mirrors and backups
processing facial recognition over genital close-ups

saving explicit content on your hard drive
encrypt the filesystem to hide it from your kids and wife
but don&#39;t worry - no data is really secure
if anybody asks me I will hand out your secrets for sure

I&#39;m a motherfucking computer, I&#39;m like [Bleep]
