 <info>---------------------------------
Oh gross! This is such
a hypocritical song!
The worst of it is
that it&#39;s inspired by
my girlfriend who is
working in London
as an au-pair. I think
I miss her too much.
This is getting too
worse... One cliche
after another...

PoZoR, 5-4-97

Oh? Some greets?
Well, okay... All
persons inside this
party place (another
cliche!) and of course
Sjaak, Lenz, HQN,
TCM, Ruuw, TBL, LED,
Simba3.001, Lancelot
and all Cheese Membaz.
