 <info>Lizard wrote to JCH: &#34;Do you remember if you made it originally or if I did? Or did we both rip off someone else/commercial tune? I bought the kawai k4 1988 so this was one of my first songs on amiga.&#34;

JCH replied: &#34;Actually it was MSK who came to me with a short template barely consisting of the bassline and the drums in the first part of the song. I added all the chords, leaders, solos, expanded the bass in the later sections, etc. But MSK had a knack of &#34;borrowing&#34; stuff from his favorite musicians (especially George Michael) so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the bassline is not original at all.&#34;</info>
