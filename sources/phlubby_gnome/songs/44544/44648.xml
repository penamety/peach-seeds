 My entry for the
 X96 music competition

 This song contains
 some home-made
 U220 samples,if you
 decide to use them,
 please credit me.
 They really took me
 alot of work!!!

 If you feel the urge
 to contact me,just
 drop a line at
 sonic@quazar.idn.nl

 Special hi&#39;s to the
 whole Destiny team.
 Respect to the whole
 music scene!

 Signing off, Sonic.


Thanx to demoralize
for letting me use his
computer to finish
this and to Diablo
for actually letting
me HEARING it :)
