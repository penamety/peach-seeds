 <info>For Nectarine compo #40 - The traditional compo [url]https://www.scenemusic.net/forum/thread/1542/[/url]

Initially was going to remix old georgian folksong Tsintskaro, which i knew from Herzog&#39;s Nosferatu (and Kate Bush) [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pTaSe4c-s[/url] to some preferably Galway-like harmonic stuff. Buuut it turned too difficult for me. 

Then in was going through old finnish traditional songs and bumped into old lullaby [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFCixLn9qRw[/url] (the melody is also sung with different lyrics, like &#34;tuu, tuu, tupakkarulla&#34;)  and thought that hey i basicly have made this already (as [url]https://www.scenemusic.net/demovibes/song/41415/[/url] ) and made the cheap move by (a)busing my old module heavily for this compo entry :dolan:
