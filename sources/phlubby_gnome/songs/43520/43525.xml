 <info>Small chiptune &#34;tribute&#34; based on Little Bitchards theme from &#34;The Code Inside&#34;.
Bonefish asked me to do it, as LBÂ´s got 40 recently and the Amiga Birthday Committee did an intro for his pleasure.

I used a YT video as reference to the original theme and developed this chippie with some artistic freedom.
