 <info>A NES cover of Elwood&#39;s track &#34;Dead Lock&#34;, entered in the first Famicompo mini and placed 5th with the total of 24 votes.

One of the first songs to use multichip sound, which is considered to be quite impressive at the time. This cover uses VRC7 and N106 chips. 

He also made another new cover of it years ago, but I prefer this one over the other.</info>
