 <info>My very first Scream Tracker song, and in fact my very first tracker song ever. In practice, a lousy rip-off of Tim Follin&#39;s Bionic Commando music on the C= 64, that continues into something else when I realized I had no idea how to copy the rest of the song. Starts and ends with a weird joke. Bionic Commando find frog. Bionic commando kill frog. Har har har, very funny. The song&#39;s name is the first word that popped in my dad&#39;s mind when he listened to it.
