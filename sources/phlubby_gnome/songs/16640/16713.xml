 <info>Lyrics:
These highly evolved creatures are members of the new world primates.
They have been known to be the most intelligent animal ever studied.
They have very sensitive hearing, and interesting mating habits.
Upon hearing a bass frequency at 60 hertz at about 130 bpm. Bass Monkies are known to start dancing like they were drugged.
Then they f**k, like crazed animals. Let me demonstrate for you.
Further field studies have provided fascinating results.
We have found that prolonged exposure of these frequencies to Bass Monkies have caused them to enter an almost ravenous state.
They begin to throw their hands in the air wildly.
Some begin to massage each other, while they foam at the mouth and fixate on shiny lights.
We have concluded that their behavior must be due to one thing, and one thing only.
It must be the music</info>
