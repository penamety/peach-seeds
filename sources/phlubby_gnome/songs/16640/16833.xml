 <info>Until now, I was lonely.
My world was empty; I was nobody.
Now you have entered, my life has changed:
I don&#39;t feel bitter, I don&#39;t feel rage.
But now I&#39;ve got to leave.
I&#39;m not guilty. I don&#39;t need a reprieve.
I see your face; the tears flow.
I&#39;m innocent. I have to go.
Babe, I love you (I love you)
I need you, I adore you (Adore you)
I need you, I adore you (Adore you)
But I just can&#39;t stay.

Babe, I love you (I love you)
I need you, I adore you (Adore you)
I need you, I adore you (Adore you)
But I just can&#39;t stay.
Babe, I love you (I love you)
I need you, I adore you (Adore you)
I need you, I adore you (Adore you)
But I just can&#39;t stay.
Babe, I love you (I love you)
I need you, I adore you...
