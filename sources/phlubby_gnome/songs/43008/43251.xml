 <info>”Speed of Time” is a tribute to the ”Back to the Future” franchise.

What you hear is composed and replayed on an Atari Falcon (a 16 MHz ”Home Computer” from 1992). This track was made to explore the machine&#39;s capabilities and the new Ace Tracker 2 software (by New Beat) which recently got an update enabling new filters and new ways to combine oscillators allowing a wider range of sounds (yes, enthusiasts still develop for the Atari platform).

Enjoy the ride and happy October 21st synth-heads!
