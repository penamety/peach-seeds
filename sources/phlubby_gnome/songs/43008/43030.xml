Hotel Continental, I was holding up the bar
He was holding up the traffic like some old-time movie star
I walked right through his entourage and gave him my best line
He flashed his car keys back at me and said &#34;your place or mine?&#34;

Broom broom, we were in his car
Broom broom, I said &#34;is it far?&#34;
Broom broom, bang bang, boom boom

Mercedes-Benz from &#39;63, shiny chrome and black
With honey-coloured leather seats, the kind that go right back
Broom broom, bang bang, boom boom
Broom broom, bang bang, boom boom

My hand caressed his gearstick; I had him in a fever
I smiled and said &#34;there must be fifty ways to love your lever&#34;
I pushed his button, flicked his switch, I took it to the limit
He handled every single curve at sixty miles a minute

Broom broom, we were in his room
Bang bang, na na, at speed of light
Car keys, yes please, I&#39;ll be needing these
Broom broom, bang bang, boom boom

Mercedes-Benz from &#39;63, shiny chrome and black
With honey-coloured leather seats, the kind that go right back
Broom broom, now I&#39;m in MY car
Broom broom, like a movie star
Broom broom, bang bang, boom boom
Broom broom, bang bang, boom boom
Broom broom, bang bang, boom boom
