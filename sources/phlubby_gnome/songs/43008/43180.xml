 <info>1st place in MULTICHANNEL TRACKED MUSIC at VIP2016. Out of 2 entries, though :)

Initial idea was to finally make High Score Tune [url]https://www.scenemusic.net/demovibes/song/30143/[/url] by me and lemonade bit better, but ended up using only couple first patterns (which were by me, thus no co-op with lemo on this one) and made some nonsense for the rest of the tune :dolan:
