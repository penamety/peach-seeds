 <info>&#34;Mm, just like lying in the grass somewhere around the Cretaceous period, this is very much a Sunday four million years ago song from our man in SF Prob. Well, ok, it goes a little disquietingly snare-rushed later, but that&#39;s just the flocks of pterodactyls swooping overhead.. they won&#39;t bother you. Don your shades and enjoy the sunshine.. only 600,000 years &#39;til that asteroid lands, no hurry.&#34;
