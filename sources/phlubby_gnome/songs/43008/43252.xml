&#34;Hello?&#34;

Natalie, you must be tired now
Because you&#39;re always running through my mind
Oh yes, I know, it is just for show
When you say that we were ??? somehow

I found your advert in a magazine
The picture got me hooked; your eyes were so pristine
I thought to myself, then I dialled your number

Natalie, you must be tired now
Because you&#39;re always running through my mind
I start to realise, suppose it&#39;s no surprise
That hooking up with me is not part of your style

I found your advert in a magazine
The picture got me hooked; your eyes were so pristine
I thought to myself, gotta stop calling your number, baby

Gotta stop calling your number, baby, tonight
Gotta stop calling your number, baby, every night...
