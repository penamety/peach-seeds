 <info>9th at Solskogen 2016 Newschool music compo

---

Thanks to Modulo One for the countless hours spent helping me progress the song, figuring out a melody that is possible to sing and for the actual singing. Yes, that is his lush and hypnotic voice you&#39;re hearing. All natural. 

Thanks to my sister for providing backing vocals on extremely short notice. Thinking about it, giving myself effectively a week to produce the entire song from scratch was not such a good idea. But here it is, as done as it&#39;s going to get before submission to Solskogen 2016&#39;s Newschool Music Competition.

Also, Tom Andr√© needs mention for playing the piano in the intro of the song. He&#39;s truly a great piano player.

Thanks to my wonderful wife for putting up with my hobby and enduring the late nights I&#39;ve had to spend to finish this song.

Shout-outs to Miu for endless amounts of production tips and tricks.</info>
