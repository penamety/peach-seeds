 <info>Lost and… found, the Castle Zone of Bilou’s Adventure was dropped as to close to the castles of Super Mario Bros 3 and the similar world of Fury of the Furries. Anyway, the music i’ve written for that was realy fun, mix of Dance and Disco with a church organ melody. That music would be great an halloween bonus stage !
At that time PPP Team promoted those available games : Pengo’s Adventure, the two first episodes of Badman, Xeen Commander and the forcoming Bilou’s Tris.
