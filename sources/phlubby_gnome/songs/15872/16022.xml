 <info>Some times, my brother had tiny melodies in mind and used Impulse Tracker to realise it, that’s how this Yeah! victorious theme was written. Anyway i thought i should polish it with some Roland synthesizer samples. The result is maybe not so great, as it lost the oldschool aspect of the track… but sounds like the audio track of PC video game of the end of the nineties.
