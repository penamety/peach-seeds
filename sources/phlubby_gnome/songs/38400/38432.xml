This one was inspired by a remix of Smack my bitch up, that Lug00ber played at Kindergarden 2012. I wanted to try and recreate that nasty bassy sound and the nice breakbeat. Not sure I succeeded as much as I&#39;d hoped. But I&#39;m definitely happy with this one, and hope all of you will enjoy this.

Great thanks to the organizers of Revision!
You&#39;re doing an amazing job for everyone to have this awesome party-experience.

Again, I have to compliment the organizers for the free coffee. That&#39;s what really keep us going when deadline is closing in!


Hope you enjoy and ...
