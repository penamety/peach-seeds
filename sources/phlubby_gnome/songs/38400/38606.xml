 <info>Once Upon A Quiver was originally released as 32k executable track by myself at Kindergarden 2011. This new version, dubbed &#34;Studiofied&#34;, is a complete rewrite from scratch :) Additional VST synths were used alongside quiver to give the song a brand new feel. 1st place in Pixeljam 2013 freestyle music competition.</info>
