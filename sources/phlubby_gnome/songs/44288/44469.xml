 <info>If you are familiar with the demoscene (especially on the PC side during the 90s) you have probably heard this tune a thousand times because of its awesomeness.

I decided to try recreating it in Logic Pro X with some soft synths. Enjoy!

The original tune was composed by Jugi Kaartinen and was released in the demo &#34;Dope&#34; by Complex at TG95.</info>
