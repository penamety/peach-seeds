 <info>I&#39;ve just finished a small test of Amiga1200 working with MIDI.
Hardware: Yamaha QY70 + Amiga 1200 (MIDI).
Software: OctaMED 4.00.

Amiga 1200 - a computer launched in 1992. 14Mhz of Motorola CPU on-board. Mine has 10Mb of RAM. The song surely would work on standard 2Mb, without problems.

Yamaha QY70 has been released in 1997. It&#39;s a very small synthesizer with sequencer (but can also work in MIDI mode), similar in its look to Atari Lynx handheld game-console.
Sound generation method: AWM2.

OctaMED 4.00 - the series generally has been closed in 1992 (later the program became freeware).
You can use 16 channels here, in the MIDI mode, however it still works as a tracker, so - for example - You cannot put a chord into one channel: You have to use 3 separate channels to make the chord.

The full album &#34;DEATH SQUAD&#34; with this song - is here: http://yerzmyey.i-demo.pl</info>
