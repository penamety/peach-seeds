<br />Additional Information:<br /><i><p>Originally released on a music demo disk on the 32-bit Archimedes computer in February 1991.  Carnival was one of the first 8-Channel Sound Tracker modules I wrote at the age of 19 under the guise BrokenARM Music. It was made on a beta test copy of !Tracker by Fabrice Mercier on an Archimedes A-310.  !Tracker was essentially an Amiga Soundtracker clone but, unusually, it supported up to 8-channels with soft panning unlike its 4-channel hard-panned counterpart. It is one of the earlier 8-channel Soundtracker music modules to be released on a home computer (Oktalyzer was released in 1989 on the Amiga). The module comprises mostly of 8-bit samples from the infamous ST-01 sample library originally bundled with Karsten Obarski&#39;s infamous Ultimate Soundtracker in 1987 on the Amiga. Released in 1987 the Archimedes was the first commercial computer to feature the 32-bit ARM RISC processor and featured 8-audio channels each with stereo panning in hardware.</p></i>
