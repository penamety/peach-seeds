[i]Lyrics:
This was a triumph
I&#39;m making a note here: 
Huge success
It&#39;s hard to overstate my satisfaction

Aperture Science
We do what we must because we can
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead

But there&#39;s no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
And the Science gets done 
and you make a neat gun
For the people who are still alive

I&#39;m not even angry
I&#39;m being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart
And killed me
And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you
Now these points of data make a beautiful line
And we&#39;re out of beta, we&#39;re releasing on time.
So I&#39;m GLaD I got burned
Think of all the things we learned
for the people who are still alive

Go ahead and leave me
I think I prefer to stay inside
Maybe you&#39;ll find someone else to help you
Maybe Black Mesa
That was a joke
Haha
Fat chance
Anyway, this cake is great
It&#39;s so delicious and moist

Look at me still talking
when there&#39;s Science to do
When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I&#39;m not you
I&#39;ve experiments to run
There is research to be done
On the people who are still alive

And believe me I am still alive
I&#39;m doing Science and I&#39;m still alive
I feel fantastic and I&#39;m still alive
While you&#39;re dying I&#39;ll be still alive
And when you&#39;re dead I will be still alive
Still alive
Still alive...
