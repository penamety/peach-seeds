Song Message:


Ahhh... back to the days when remixes sounded decent and only took up 100
KB or so. Well, I&#39;m kidding. This aint that great, and it&#39;s a little over
100 KB.. but at least I got this song to sound how I truly wanted it to at
heart. This is the kind of music I hear when I listen to Final Fantasy
music. Let&#39;s hope that I can continue to have as much fun making remixes
as I have this one, ne? :) Thank you for listening.
