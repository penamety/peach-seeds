 <info> You stand on a cliff just outside a dungeon exit with your party members,
looking over a lush green landscape with mountains in the distance. The
sky is a mix of deep red, orange, and dark blue. Three moons fill the sky
overhead. It is sunset.

The world looks so mysterious. It is your first time seeing the world, as
the evil empire has locked you and your companions up in the underworld,
as well as the rest of the population. To them there is no outside. Nor is
there a way.

You discover that you and everyone you have ever known has been lied to
about their surroundings. So, you set forth on a journey to discover what
lies ahead. Good luck, hero.
