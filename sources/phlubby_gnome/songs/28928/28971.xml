 <info>Hello there. Yet another track from skyline/ Dragoon-kun. This is one of
my personal favorites...


Seeing how many songs were made for the FF series, I decided to do the
Zelda series some justice. I plan on making a lot more in the near future.
I hope that the tracking I&#39;ve done lately has improved my style. Until
then, enjoy this song!

Best listened to with a KOSS headset along with IT 2.14.</info>
