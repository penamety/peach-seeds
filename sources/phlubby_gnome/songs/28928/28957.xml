 <info>.story behind the music.

   well, one day I was just browsing the internet like any other day. i
hadn&#39;t been too inspired to write anything outside of lame OHC entries,
and was starting to get kinda frusterated and gave up. after i wrote
&#34;whirlpool of feelings&#34; with my friend melvyl, i had a big urge to write a
very emotional tune, something with a spiffy beat to it, and enough melody
to keep a listener coming back for more. unfortunately that never
happened, but then in hellven&#39;s chat room, we started talking about nogsf
and her wonderful music, as well as some of the other female trackers out
there and commending them for churning out some truly elegant music. so
anyway, i went and downloaded some of nogsf&#39;s music, and thought &#34;holy
crap, this stuff is really really good. must have more!&#34; so i went to her
site and got more. ;) the result of listening to it? this song.

a remix of &#34;dr0m i paradis&#34; (dream in paradise). enjoy.

from the bottom of my heart, thanks to nogsf for writing great music, and
letting me remix her wonderful song. i hope this makes her happy :) also,
thanks to all my friends in hellven and sstrax that constantly support me
and keep me going.</info>
