 <info> LYRICS:	
	
look to the sky.	
ready to die.	
wish i had wings to fly,	
to get closer to you.	
	
you are so high.	
wait for the night.	
i see you standing there	
trying to find me.	
	
please let me die.	
do it tonight.	
i have no else to love,	
i have nothing to lose.	
	
look to the sky.	
i&#39;m ready to die.	
i see you crying there.	
i&#39;m coming for you.	
	
	
the night you past away,	
no last words, nothing to	
 say.	
i wait for nothingness.	
last request: take me away.	
	
	
CHORUS:	
i&#39;m waiting for the night	
to see your star in the	
 sky.	
i&#39;m waiting for the night	
to see your face in moon-	
 light.	
	
	
look to the sky.	
ready to die.	
i have no reason to live,	
when i am without you.	
	
you are so high.	
wait for the night.	
i see you standing there	
trying to find me (find me)	
	
please make me die.	
do it tonight.	
i want to fly trough the	
 light,	
i am missing you so.	
	
look to the sky.	
i&#39;m ready to die.	
i see you crying there.	
i&#39;m coming for you.	
	
	
the night you past away,	
no last words, nothing to	
 say.	
i wait for nothingness.	
last request: take me away.
