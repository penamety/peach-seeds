spoken: i am a fairy, i am a big boogie man, you are all schizos!

once, a long time ago, a man traveled along a road,
encountered a bush-cricket who knew almost everything,
it sure told you, (you could) ask anything,
it provided answers as if from a drugstore&#39;s shelves

then the man happened to ask something totally stupid,
the bush-cricket did not answer,
it took brass knuckles, and beat him up hard ...ouch!

well, well, well, we would have been saved from this,
had we been just a bit smarter (2x)

(repeat from *)
