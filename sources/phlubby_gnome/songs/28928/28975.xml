Hot damn, this is the first serious module I&#39;ve tracked since tokyo&#39;s
sunset. let&#39;s see.. impulse tracker says I&#39;ve been working at this for two
hours and ten minutes. straight. I&#39;ve never been able to sit here for more
than an hour.

Boy, if it only takes me 2 hours to crank this out, I wonder what would
happen if I put even more time into it :P haha. Anyway, enjoy!</info>
