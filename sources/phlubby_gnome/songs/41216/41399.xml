 <info>A MIDI song composed for Wild Compo of SillyVenture 2014 Atari Party.

This is kind of micromusic I made in MIDI standard, using two machines from 80s:

- a sound-module Roland MT-32 (8 channels + drums) - 1987
- ATARI 520ST (with Cubase 2.1 as the sequencer) - 1985

I don&#39;t have any opportunity to play live some improvisations when I use trackers, so this time - with MIDI - it was kind of fun. :)

Also I think people tend to forget the MIDI is Atari&#39;s power, so I just wanted to remind it. ;)

Enjoy.
