 <info>The song comes from my album &#34;Chiptunes&#34; (October 2014) downloadable from here: yerzmyey.i-demo.pl/

AMIGA 500 (8 channels).
Made with OctaMED.
Requires 1Mb of ChipRam.
Recorded from real hardware. (Stereo slightly changed).

Yesssssssss. After 20 years I made an 8-channels module on Amiga500 AGAIN. ;) I wasn&#39;t sure how it would work, as once can&#39;t actually use volumes in this mode, on OctaMED. It&#39;s because there is only 4 volumes for 8 traxx then. Which suxx. So it&#39;s better not to use volumes at all and make more &#39;version&#39; of samples, with various volumes.
Also the sound-quality gets much lower in the 8ch mode. But whatta hell - why not to force old good A500 to some harder work (software mixing: actually two chips play the music: Paula but also Motorola :) ).

Enjoy this small experiment. ;)
