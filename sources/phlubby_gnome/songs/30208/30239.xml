 <info>so far, still unsteady. barely breathing, life so slow.
so fragile, still voiceless: a name, you&#39;ll never know.

say goodnight and close your eyes
until these dreams are over.
running to / run into the arms of guardian angels

go alone, i cannot follow,
i stood away and shed no tears.
i know you wished for something better,
but where your lover lay is now a soul of stone,
my dear.

even though i know that i might never be forgiven,
it&#39;s a chance i&#39;ll take, and if i break you heart
you know i&#39;ll never be the same.

finally i know that i can never be forgiven.</info>
