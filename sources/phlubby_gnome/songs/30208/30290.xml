 <info>Released at X&#39;2010 outside of competition. This is a lovely 80&#39;ish interpretation of JCH&#39;s everlasting piece of c64 sid history. This rearrangement does indeed contain the real sidchip, but not a single bleep from the original tune. I keep the tradition that every single tone you hear was created and played by myself. No samples, loops from anybody else, just unique real music. I leave remixing to others and I hope that you enjoy my little contribution to what is the only party that ever existed. We are one big family and the roots of all blip blop, we still get together after 23 years and we&#39;ll probably all die together with the finger at the back of the action replay cartridge. I salute everyone who has ever in their life catched the spirit of the real underground and who did things outsiders would never understand :) My deepest respect to all who still contribute. Without you, the c64 would have been forgotten in history and been nothing else than a real huge ashtray. You all gave life to a fantastic machine and to a movement that still globally exists today and is taken as granted by everyone - however this tune is dedicated to those proud people who still live the original spirit. May we all live forever in the history of computing.</info>
