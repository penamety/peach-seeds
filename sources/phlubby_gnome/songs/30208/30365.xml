 <info>Can you feel it, see it, hear it today?
Well, if you can&#39;t, then you&#39;ve got to be deaf in some way
And you will never understand what (...??? inaudible)
And it feels like your ears are made of glass

It&#39;s so cool, it&#39;s so hip, it&#39;s so right
It&#39;s so groovy, it&#39;s outta sight
You can&#39;t touch it nor smell it but it still is so sweet
And the sound of the SID makes you move your feet

You want a SID and you&#39;re gonna get it

[Splippen, ploppen?] that&#39;s what it&#39;s for
So you flip the disk and then you listen some more
You&#39;ve got to sing it, got to say it,
Then you bring it and then you play it

You want a SID and you&#39;re gonna get it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It&#39;s in your ears and you can&#39;t hear it (yeah, yeah, yeah)

It&#39;s alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It&#39;s magic, not tragic, and it plays when you win
It&#39;s dry, not moist; it&#39;s a parent&#39;s pain
I&#39;m back, it happened and I&#39;m not ashamed

It&#39;s SID (what is SID?)
It&#39;s SID (what is SID?)
It&#39;s the SID (but what is SID?)
SID (what is SID?)
It&#39;s the SID (yeah, but what the fuck is the SID?)
It&#39;s the SID
Oh, it&#39;s the SID (what is SID?)
It&#39;s the SID (what is SID?)
It&#39;s the SID
It&#39;s the SID
Oh, it&#39;s the SID
Oh, it&#39;s the SID
