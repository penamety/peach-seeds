 <info>Lyrics:
The night was cold and bitter
He was looking for an inn
When the devil shined before him
Showing off an awful grin

The demon spake &#34;You&#39;re frozen&#34;
And he nodded to the beast
&#34;A fee so small&#34; the dark one said
&#34;Can make your life a feast&#34;

Chorus:
Come within these walls of mine
Before the frost thee bite
Grab yourself a bottle of wine
And drink it with delight

Come within these walls of mine
Before the frost thee bite
At me table you will dine
Get yourself another pint


Well the young man said &#34;don&#39;t bother
Soon I&#39;ll find an inn
Because your home and castle
Is built on wicked sin&#34;

The Devil looked offended
As the offer was denied
But still he opened up the door
And invited him inside

Come within these walls of mine
Before the frost thee bite
At me table you will dine
Get yourself another pint

The demon kept on preaching
&#34;I can make you whole&#34;
&#34;And all I ask of you, good sir
Is your immortal soul&#34;

The dark one asked &#34;Are you not tempted?&#34;
He said &#34;Not the least!&#34;
For little did the devil know
the man talking was a priest 

Come within these walls of mine
Before the frost thee bite
At me table you will dine
Get yourself another pint</info>
