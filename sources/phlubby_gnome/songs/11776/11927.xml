 <info>Yes, this is the sequel to famous tune  &#34;Cosmic (Out)flow&#34;. No, it does not resemble the &#34;first part&#34; by any means.
It is a very atmospheric tune but it lacks the brilliance of its predecessor. However it still remains just a good tune definitely worth of being heard.</info>
