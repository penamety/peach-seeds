 <info>One of the most famous and strange &#34;cosmic&#34; tunes in the tracker music history. Review from modarchive.org:

this was noa nakai&#39;s entry in Assembly 2001, and won 3rd place for it. its one of my favorite techno songs; interestingly it sounds influenced by Purple motion&#39;s sine-wave masterpiece, &#34;Satellite One&#34;. Well, you can&#39;t blame someone for being influenced by Purple Motion. This song really is awesome in the beginning, promising great things later on in the song, and it absolutely and completly delivers the goods around 1:35. WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW AMAZING THIS SONG IS. The first 1:35 of the song is essentially variations on the same theme, where different instruments take a shot on the whole &#34;Hovering thru&#34; idea, and the overlap and interplay is brilliant, and the pads wonderfully complement his ideas. Then, around 1:16, there is a bridge that connects the introduction with the main section at 1:35.</info>
