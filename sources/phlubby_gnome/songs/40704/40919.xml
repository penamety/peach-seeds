 <info>Info from Soundcloud:

Hey people,
I recently got some sweet melodies in my head. So I decided to put them to notes and hit record.

The outcome was this chip-disco track &#34;Window of Opportunities&#34; which has some adventurous crossovers. It was inspired by the new year - 2014, Sci-fi-channel UFO-documetaries and various C64-tunes.

The working name for this chiptune-ninja was something like &#34;soup kitchen&#34;, but it grew into something more energetic and I threw in some more production as well.

Hope you enjoy this powered-up chiptune for all you bleepers in 2014! Cheers.
