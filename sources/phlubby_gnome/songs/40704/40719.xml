Lyrics:

you want / you wanted / you exercise your right to choose
you slide / you hold on / you mutilate all that you made
you&#39;re spent / you&#39;re broken / can&#39;t spare another cent to waste

temptation, desire / adjacent to these eyes
please talk to me / in empty dreams

you slide / you hold on / you are the one they called upon
you take / you&#39;re taken / you take in all that which was faked

temptation, desire / adjacent to these eyes
please talk to me / in empty dreams

temptation, desire / encapsulating lies
please talk to me / in empty dreams</info>
