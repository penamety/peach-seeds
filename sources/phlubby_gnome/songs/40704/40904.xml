 <info>Info from Soundcloud:

Hey ppl,
Here I bring you a little chiptune track called &#39;Magnolia Bakery&#39;.
I visited NY not long ago (which was a blast btw) and while I was there I went to the Magnolia bakery on Bleecker st. This track represents that good day.
It&#39;s dedicated to all the chiptune fans following my page (you&#39;re awesome) and when I was composing this I was in a pure a sugar rush state. Hope it&#39;s just as sweet as the cupcakes at Magnolia bakery!
