 <info>Lyrics:
Looking at the sky your image everywhere
Thinking all the time how could I show you that I care
If only I could have you that&#39;s all I desire
But all I have is feeling burning in my heart like fire
I know that you want that it would be like before
Maybe you will see me when you open the door
All I need is to know that you are here
And all the bad thoughts in my head will disappear

Can ever be like before</info>
