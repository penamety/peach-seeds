  TITLE: Stationary Ark
 ARTIST: John Mills-Cockell &lt;?&gt;
COMMENT: &#34;Theme from Stationary Ark, a nature show on PBS. [...] It appears on
         Synth Sample as interpreted by a friend of mine. I didn&#39;t know what it
         was myself until I happened to see Stationary Ark one time. This song
         does not play properly on some C-64&#39;s where the SID chip filter is
         calibrated differently.&#34; (GF)</info>
