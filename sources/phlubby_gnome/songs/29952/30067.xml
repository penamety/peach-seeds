 <info>Blue Street
el blanco [fulcrum]
a hair over 3 minutes (like 3:05)

Greetz to fulcrum members, especially Coplan! Yannick for making FT2, old skool #trax-ers and the rest.

This song has quite a few firsts for me. It&#39;s my first tune since joining [fulcrum], my first Mad Tracker 2 tune, and the first new song I&#39;ve written in like...5 years.

It&#39;s a bit slow, but so am I now that I&#39;m getting older. Enjoy.</info>
