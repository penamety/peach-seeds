This short little tune was the one I made for our 4k intro &#34;Bait&#34; which we entered @ Assembly 2010. Ultimately, we decided to go with Coplan&#39;s tune for the intro which is thematically *much* better for an intro with a story about a giant alien space station that eats planets. But I thought I should release this anyways.

It&#39;s 100% 4klang http://4klang.untergrund.net/ which is an amazing little piece of software. It&#39;s my first real go at using this thing, so I&#39;m pretty happy with how it turned out. Get the .4kp file from http://fulcrum.antisoc.net/ if you want to hear this thing. Otherwise hunt and poke around as I pretty much just used the presets.</info>
