[???]
Here is a light
Maybe I could [???]
I could be [???]
all [???] to you and me
all the sounds [???]
The sun on your shoulder

I know [???] inside of your love
By those words
[???]
Blessed by those words
Be by my side
Blinded of you

[???] of your love I&#39;ve had to take this time
[This is why] I don&#39;t sleep at night
I&#39;m in love for you and me
Share those words
I have to say
You have to say

I need to rest
[???] only be for you
I just have to take this time
being in love
and all the sounds of it

I need to rest...
I&#39;m with you

[???]
[???]
The [sun] [???]
Your love
[???]
Cry

[???] of your love I&#39;ve had to take this time
[???] I don&#39;t sleep at night
I&#39;m in love for you and me
Share those words you have to say

I just have to take this time
only for me to ignore this Monday morning
It&#39;s going to end
[rising up] to better days

I need to rest...
I&#39;m with you

[???]
[???]
The sun on your shoulder [???]
[???] by your love

I know [???] inside of your love
By those words, just words
Blessed by those words
Be by my side
Blinded of you

[???] of your love I&#39;ve had to take this time
[This is why] I don&#39;t sleep at night
I&#39;m in love for you and me
Share those words you have to say</info>
