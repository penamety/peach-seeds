That Connection Feeling
3:12

I set out to write a tune without the aid of drums or percussion (which I usually use with a bit too much gusto to cover up inadequacies in my song writing). I ended up with this little semi-minimalist tune.

I got this far with it pretty quickly, but when I set out to try to expand upon it I always ended up hitting a brick wall. As I listened and listened and listened to the tune to figure out how to approach it again, I realized that my head was always ending up a good place after listening to this tune.

I decided to leave it alone since I think this little song ended up giving more out of it than I put into it.</info>
