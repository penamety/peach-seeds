el blanco [fulcrum]
(4:05)

Greetz to fulcrum members, Yannick
Yannick for making MT2, etc. etc.

This is my second tune for fulcrum. This started off completely different, and rapidly turned into this as I messed around with the original 4 parts of the phrase/progression. I just kept tossing on and removing layers until I found something I really liked. Structurally it&#39;s pretty boring, the same thing over and over with new layers here and there, one key change up 3 half-steps, climax....then work it&#39;s way out.</info>
