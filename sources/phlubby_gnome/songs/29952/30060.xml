Dance    of    the   Dead
///////////////////////////
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&lt;arranged by Chromatic    &gt;
&lt;Dragon with excerpts from&gt;
&lt;pieces originally written&gt;
&lt;and produced by Andrew   &gt;
&lt;Sega : Necros of Legend  &gt;
&lt;Design / Psychic Monks / &gt;
&lt;FM                       &gt;
That message above should
be clear. There&#39;s lots of
original stuff in here, but
the main purpose of this is
an arrangement.
Note: each arrangement was
made from MEMORY. No part
was taken directly from any
of the songs. And if you
don&#39;t believe me, tough. :&gt;

You can call this kissing
ass, brown nosing, what you
will, but this song aint
it. Some composers in this
day and age are so good
that other composers start
to do pieces based on their
original themes. I wrote
this because of all that I
have heard, Necros is the
most influential in what I
write, and in my opinion
by far and away the most
respected tracker on the
planet.

Well, enough of the trying
to fend off controversy...
let&#39;s skip to the greetz!

Samples from Robert Allen,
Basehead, Whale Bone, and
Necros, of course. He also
added patterns 50-59 and
gussied it up! Mucho thanx.

Greets to:

Base, k8to, Pop, GD, Hacker
CC, Danc, Maelcum, DD, Miss
Saigon, Sirrus, etc..

All in all, I really hope
you enjoy listening to this
piece as much as I enjoyed
tracking it. Took me a
whole evening, it being
7:00 AM now and I only just
got off IRC last night
getting Orbital 2 and
Eternity... man, this stuff
is an addiction! :)

Cya!
