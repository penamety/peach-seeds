Lyrics (very incomplete):
Look at...
Your system and your []
straight into their throats
Either drop a mic [onto the ground]
or shoot your head out with a []
Its a sure shot
don&#39;t you []
drop it, no stop it [] call this a co-opt
terrabase raging, [breaking the sounds of the powerful]
to throw s*** into another wall
[not to a foreign ]
look, I am bigger, [] rocking the walls
[]
[no heed or feed]
to sound radical, magical, why
look at [] proper trouble
this used to be a [mine]
[proper lineup for the][]
[Server Genie] now

but you don&#39;t hear it
keep the [] right, alive and moving
they don&#39;t need to [] they&#39;re removing mine
[] as big as my smile
feeling [] you miss me by a mile...

This song is a remix of &#34;Bulls on Parade&#34; by Rage Against the Machine
