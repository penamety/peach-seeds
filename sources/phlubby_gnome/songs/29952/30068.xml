[fulcrum]
5:32

After a bit of a lull and constant interruptions by real-life(TM), finally, another tune.
Greetz to fulcrum, coplan, others etc.
I really focused on VSTi usage in this one. Pretty much all the instruments (except for the drums) are VSTis. 
I really enjoy using the Angular Momentum Additive Table Synth by Laif Oddson &amp; Thomas Weber. Just love those delicious sounds it puts out. If only it didn&#39;t crash madtracker all the time! I mainly used some presets with a few minor tweaks.
The piano is Steinberg&#39;s &#34;The Grand&#34; run through MT2&#39;s flanger to make it fit in with the trance sound.
The drums are all samples I had lying around.</info>
