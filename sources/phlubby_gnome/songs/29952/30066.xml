I really liked the full mix of &#34;Accidental Ray of Sun&#34;. I also really like playing around with Steinberg&#39;s &#34;The Grand&#34;. I realized the song could be adapted to a piano only tune without much complication -- so I arranged it for the VSTi. 

Turned out really nice.

Due to some flakiness in &#34;The Grand&#34; I split the piano up between two different VSTi so it would have enough polyphony for the entire song.</info>
