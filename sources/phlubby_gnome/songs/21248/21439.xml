 <info>From the music disk &#34;blur plastiq&#34;, ftp://ftp.scene.org/mirrors/hornet/music/disks/1996/fm-plast.zip.  Notes from Mellow-D:

        My good friend Tero Kokko (zapster) brought over some CD&#39;s
        one day for me to sample, which is where I got most of the
        loops from.  The &#34;fade away&#34; sample is from the AWESOME
        Apollo 440 song Liquid Cool. The man shouting is not me,
        it&#39;s someone from can&#39;t-remember-where.

        There&#39;s always a constant beat in the background, panned
        to somewhere so that it&#39;s not in the foreground when it
        isn&#39;t supposed to be.  The filtered samples (not 303)
        are from miscellaneous synths that I&#39;ve borrowed or had,
        for example the Wavestation A/D.

        No personal feelings or such here, I had just been jonesing
        for a groove.  I like the way the bass and the filters
        talk to each other, along with that one (the short) pad.

        Ooh. Me didgeridoo. Them filters. Near the end.
