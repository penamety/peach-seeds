 <info>&#34;This track was written in 1995 by me and now it was fully reworked and by the way: I&#39;ve cut the first part of song, cause &#34;Julia&#34; must bring only bright tones into your heart, and nothing more ;) and the first part is too sad for it. If you liked first part, listen to Julia &#39;95

To be enjoyed :)&#34;
