<br />Additional Information:<br /><i><p>This song is more of a bet and a demonstration than something I wanted to do.</p>

<p>Me and a good friend of mine were invited to a party of our former schoolmate, and had an interesting discussion. Soon after the disco part started, we began bitching about the extreme simplicity of modern dance music.</p>

<p>Neither of us is really in contact with such music, and after a while of listening and counting the chords in songs (some of which had like 2 or so), I told him that anyone could come up something like this in three days with no effort.</p>

<p>I made this song to prove my point, and to see what the reception will be.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this social experiment ended very expectedly. While no one really knows about my orchestral pieces, this track circulated in lightspeed.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the story of this overly simple track, done in a few days only by featuring everything a modern EDM piece has to have.</p>

<p>Sad enough.</p>
