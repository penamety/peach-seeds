 <info>&#34;Hello again! This incredible tune dedicated to all (ex)ZX and AMIGA users !
...Now 13.09.98..three days ago, i get from C.T.Sam four Funtop98 ZX disk images... After viewing it&#39;s content my mood has no range,and i started tracking the module...
The module contain four themes:
1 - Originally from ZXgame &#34;StarTrip&#34;
2 - Originally from ZXgame &#34;Sigma-T&#34;
3 - Originally from ZXgame &#34;Turrican-II&#34;
4 - Originally from The Lyra-II Megademo (part 8)
Theme 3 has a little major improvement by me.
Laser disco forever@
Sample statistics:
2 y.e. - from CD collection.
3 y.e. - from my synth
1 y.e. - CD RIP
any one - from my HDD collection...
Coming soon Bytefall98...
...hear around..a TRUE REVERB effect on just 20 channels!  :+)
