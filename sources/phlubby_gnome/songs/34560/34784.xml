A wonderful dream of love and peace for everyone 
Of living our lives in perfect harmony 
A wonderful dream of joy and fun for everyone 
To celebrate a life where all are free 

When the world is ever changing 
Like a candle in the dark 
There&#39;s a source of inspiration in the air 
Let the magic dry your tears and heal your heart 

A wonderful dream... [x2]

Watch out, look around 
To celebrate a life where all are free 
Watch out, look around 
Love is coming feeling around 
Watch out, look around 
love is coming feeling around 
Watch out, look around 
feel the love, feel the love, feel the love is a wonderful dream

A wonderful dream... [x2]

Now the children&#39;s eyes are shining 
Like they never shone before 
Let their dreams and aspirations light our way 
Living life in harmony forever more 

A wonderful dream...</info>
