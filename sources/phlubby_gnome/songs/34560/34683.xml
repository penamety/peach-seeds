 <info>This song is more of a bet and a demonstration than something I wanted to do.

Me and a good friend of mine were invited to a party of our former schoolmate, and had an interesting discussion. Soon after the disco part started, we began bitching about the extreme simplicity of modern dance music.

Neither of us is really in contact with such music, and after a while of listening and counting the chords in songs (some of which had like 2 or so), I told him that anyone could come up something like this in three days with no effort.

I made this song to prove my point, and to see what the reception will be.

Needless to say, this social experiment ended very expectedly. While no one really knows about my orchestral pieces, this track circulated in lightspeed.

That&#39;s the story of this overly simple track, done in a few days only by featuring everything a modern EDM piece has to have.

Sad enough.
