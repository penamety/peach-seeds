<br />Additional Information:<br /><i><p>More Italodisco. One Night With You is another step closer to perfection when it comes to imitating the 80s eurodance style.</p>

<p>This track evolved quite a lot, I made and discarded at least three different starting ideas until I was satisfied and carried on with the rest of the track. But it was worth it.</p>

<p>The song implements basically everything Michiel Van der Kuy used in his late &#39;80s production. Again, authentic synthesizers and samples were used; arranged in a standard italo song structure.</p>

<p>I doubt it&#39;s possible to get even closer without copying the actual melodies (which I did not). Imitation of style is one thing, but keeping it original is as much important.</p>

<p>The track itself was composed during ~4 days just before Christmas 2011. As usual, many hours of listening, and thorough research of 80s material was needed. But at the same time, much experience was gained!</p>

<p>I&#39;ll stop here, and let the music take you back to the 80s. Just sit back, and listen to that synth brass; spacey bells and syncleads; mighty stabs; and driving basslines. :)</p>
