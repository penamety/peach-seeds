lyrics translated:

Customers are present, consults are present, managers of corporation are present

Everything is in OK! (...not that we cared whether consultants are OK)

The project may begin! (Hmm.. okay... right)

Specs are there! Hellurei! (4x)
Everything is ok. Hellurei! (4x)

Specs are there - why aren&#39;t you coding?
(microsoft sound, oh, yes! oh, yes!)
Let&#39;s code now!

Fantastic! Fantastic programmers, fantastic! This is fantastic! (2x)
Everything is ok!

There&#39;s a code [error sound] - Why doesn&#39;t it work? Oh...

Hellurei! (4x, the struggle is tough, what an ugly looking monitor)

Yes! Everything is ok!

There&#39;s a bug - oh... - why don&#39;t you debug?

Hellurei! (2x), we&#39;re struggling badly, Hellurei!
Let&#39;s code now!

Fantastic! Fantastic programmers, fantastic! This is fantastic! (2x)

TWO SECONDS LEFT! LET&#39;S CODE NOW!

Even though it&#39;s a terrible hustle, that doesn&#39;t bother us

LET&#39;S CODE NOW!

Fantastic! Fantastic programmers, fantastic! This is fantastic! (2x)

LET&#39;S CODE NOW!

Yes! Everything&#39;s OK! There it is! (fanfare)

Everything is OK!

(telephone rings)
-Mmm... 
-We have this software
-Aha..?
-So how does this actually work?
-Oh...

LET&#39;S CODE NOW!</info>
