 <info>Originally done in 2001 on Octamed Soundstudio it got released as a single mp3 on the Moods Plateau Label.

It is more or less an inofficial Drum &amp; Bass Dub cover of DJ Chemistry &amp; Jack Smooth&#39;s track &#34;Alchemy&#34; released on Homegrown Records in 1994.

Ten years later in 2011, when I decided to have some of my stuff pressed on vinyl, this was chosen to become the B-Side to Mental Climax. So I took up the project again, migrated it to DBM and overworked it.
