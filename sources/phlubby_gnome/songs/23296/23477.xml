 <info>&#34;I actually like this one. I paid more attention to sound quality and mixing than I usually do in modules, and I think it turned out quite alright. The last two parts are unnecessary, could&#39;ve just ended the tune before them. The &#34;beat is working&#34; vocals are from some terrible a cappella rap that I found on the web. Oh, and I just remembered, at the time I was trying to capture a specific setting or landscape in my tunes - while tracking this one I thought of the words &#34;enchanted forest&#34;. I suppose I thought of it less when I added the rap though :)&#34;

Ranked 2nd in the tracked music compo at Breakpoint 2005 held in Rundsporthalle, Bingen am Rhein, Germany from 25th to 28th March, 2005.</info>
