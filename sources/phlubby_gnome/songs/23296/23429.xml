 <info>&#34;The theme melody for this one was originally slightly different. I changed it when I realised I&#39;d stolen it from the Jamiroquai song &#39;Destitute Illusions&#39; :) Initially the drumset was also weaker, I think the final drum sounds were provided by Tempest. Oh, and for the dumb title: it&#39;s 118bpm, 64kb, and... hang on, I&#39;ve actually forgot what 194 stood for. Oh well.&#34;
