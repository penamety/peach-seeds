 <info>&#34;I started to compose Journey to Bali on my Korg MicroX. I started with a bells preset and wrote a 30-second loop. Then I just left it at that and made some other 30-second songs. My girlfriend really liked &#39;Journey to Bali&#39; and she asked me if I could finish it for her mp3 player. So actually there was no way not to finish it, she is much stronger than me :) The final version was not made on the MicroX because I had to sell it. So you don&#39;t hear those bells :( I&#39;m very sad because they sound much better than this plastic guitar like instrument now. For the final version I used: Roland Juno-G (piano, clarinet, guitar and harph), Atmosphere (strings), Trilogy (bass), Session drummer 2 (guess what ;) and one loop in the background. For sequencing I use an ableton live 5. All of instruments are played by myself and are not quantized :)&#34; -Siatek
