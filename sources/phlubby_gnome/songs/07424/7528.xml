 <info>Heyhey.. this is an innncredible track i&#39;ve just finish, written on impulse tracker AND Buzz.. insieme ;p

first this track was written for Heatown Project developped by Toad of Bou√© Team. But he told me : &#34;please jeff, stop this year u&#39;ve just mad chippy demoscene track&#34; ;( .. and he&#39;s right.. once again this track sounds chippy demoscene...

But to be honnest, that&#39;s maybe cause i&#39;m for now boycotted by nectarine (no more cj new tracks) .. and i would like to prove all the nectarine listners, what i&#39;m able to do for them.. that i would like to be a nectarine boy! (that why i finally called the track nectarinization : la revenge)

so well toad , sorry.. i will finally succeed to create the track(s) u need!! i promise..

sceners.. i&#39;m here for you.. so enjoy this crazy track!!!</info>
