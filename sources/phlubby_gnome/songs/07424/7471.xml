 <info>Lyrics:
(We are nerds, we rule the world)

We are naive,
&#39;cause it&#39;s the best way.
We hate to dance,
We think that disco sucks.
We love machines,
They do what we command.
We hate romance,
Except the CPU.

We are nerds, we rule the world,

We hate to speak,
No, words are not enough.
We hate to dress,
The fashion is a joke.
We hate work,
Those robots are so stiff.
We love to work,
With automated bot.

(We are nerds, we rule the world)
You go, boy!

There is certainly communication here,
and exactly what this body language is saying,
is still the subject of intense discussion.</info>
