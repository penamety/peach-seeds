 <info>[i]So you decided to listen to this tune even though you could have pressed the skip button? Well, it is your own fault now. ;) This particular track was done back in 2014 when I had a period of wanting to make something different from my usual style. This tune was never used in any kind of production or released so I dug this out from my hard drive just so I could annoy you. :) Anyway, this track refers to the unfortunately use of science in wars. It&#39;s sad that it&#39;s only when there is a war that science/inventions make great leaps of progress..  Sometimes it seems like we have to be evil to actually evolve. But there is always hope that we will get smarter someday and won&#39;t use wars as an excuse to test out new inventions. Science should be used for our survival instead. Someday we might need to relocate to another planet..   Well, enough of this rambling so it&#39;s time to restart the text or play another tune..[/i]</info>
