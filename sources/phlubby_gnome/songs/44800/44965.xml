 <info>[i]This tune started out in a hotel room on a laptop, which meant working with software synths only. It remained largely unchanged after the stay. I used a synth called &#34;Zebra 2&#34; for mostly everything. Percussion samples are ripped from various drum-machines, sprinkled with the sound of metal cans being thrown into a metal container. Arranged in Reaper.[/i]</info>
