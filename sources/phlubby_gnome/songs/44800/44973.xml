 <info>[i]&#34;Visions Of Tyrell&#34; is a homage to the amazing Blade Runner Soundtrack by Vangelis, with a mix of orchestral sounds, moody FX and huge bold synths...   This piece is based on work I had done a while ago on a game project that unfortunately didn&#39;t work out, so I finished and released it for my Patreon project (more info at https://www.patreon.com/chris_huelsbeck ). Also check out my Bandcamp with a growing catalog of 38 releases: https://chrishuelsbeck.bandcamp.com/

Happy that I could be a part of this compilation - rock on! :)
