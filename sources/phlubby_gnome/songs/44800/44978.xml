 <info>Hi dudes, we have merged our minds and created a laid-back, easy-listening tune with funky elements for your precious ears! Hopefully it will please you as much as it did us while creating this tune exchanging the Cubase work files from Norway to Germany and back lots of times! :) We really enjoy working together and we hope the tune reflects that to you guys! Enjoy the trip, firm handshakes from Jogeir &amp; Rapture! :)</info>
