 <info>[i]A cynical stab at the 80&#39;s retro music market. Whole project took about two weeks from start to finish, one of which was after the SOS4 deadline. Drums sampled and sliced from Aretha Franklin - Every Girl (Wants My Guy). Background vocals by Lea. The electric guitar is an Epiphone Les Paul. Acoustic guitar is a Washburn. Bass guitar is a Fender Jazz Bass. Most of the percussive effects are recorded in my garage, clashing various objects together. Toms are sampled from various drum machines. Arranged and mixed in Reaper.[/i]</info>
