 <info>[i]Lonely light pole standing alone by the old path. Ancient path through the forbidden forest. Darkness surrounding everywhere. It&#39;s so cold, oh it&#39;s so cold breathing hurts my lungs.    Skies were clear when I started my journey, now it has been snowing for long I can&#39;t even remember how it felt to travel without the white roadblock. Fresh snow makes my determined footsteps disappear behind my back. I really should keep on moving, but the magical shine of light pole has imprisoned me. I really should hurry up and travel through the deserted forest to meet Miss Spring. Then things will be great again.... but just for a while. Composing started January 2018 - Composed with PC Reason by Propellerhead - Greetings to friends &lt;3[/i]</info>
