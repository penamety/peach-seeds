 <info>[i]This track was originally created for an oldschool shooter, specifically - you guessed it - for the desert level. As the track for that level was changed, this ended on the &#34;wtf should I do with it?&#34;-list. Well, thanks to Ziphoid I think we found a very good solution, quite an honor to distribute something to the SoS-Compilation. Greetings to the whole SceneSat-team and to the guys from GRG.
