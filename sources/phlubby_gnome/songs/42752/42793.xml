 <info>When the new Audacious Audio Player was upgraded and the Software missed the &#39;J&#39; Key for searching through the Song Library and i thought it is a Computer error and rebootet. I decided, to use Windows 7 for a few Minutes. Soon i found a Project File from 2008, changed it a bit and later added some C64 MSSIAH sounds. The corpus of it is like i want it to have. But as in most of such Music i make, I&#39;m sick &amp; tired at the end, from having a Windows 7 experience.

Don&#39;t advice any other Microsoft Product to me. I won&#39;t use it. [long] 
And Thanks for the [Fish] :-)
