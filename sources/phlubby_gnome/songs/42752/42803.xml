 <info>Made&#39; my first TECHNO track with SEQ24 we covered in Version 0.9.3 from removal in Gentoo&#39;s tree! It is a bit noisy. But a MIX with the SIDStation 6581 is very hard like a violine, it changes the shape of sound every few seconds. So you have to take care of a bunch of tasks while adding notes to SEQ24. controlling the 8580 is not so hard. Well, I was a bit without idea at the end.
