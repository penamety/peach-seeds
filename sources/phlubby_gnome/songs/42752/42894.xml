 <info>GENESIS - ILLEGAL ALIEN (8bit cover)

The original song is from 1984! Wow! Now here we are in 2016 redoing it in a souped up style that itself is emulating the late 80&#39;s/early 90&#39;s gaming technology. haha!

Started this cover sometime in the later 2000&#39;s for my housemate Keenan... Finally finished. 2016. What! Created in SchismTracker in my typical oldschool fashion :P But I did take advantage of the lowpass filter of the later versions of Impulse Tracker.
