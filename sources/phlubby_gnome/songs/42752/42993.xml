I had a dream.
I could really feel
the reality.
I could touch the
reality.
I could see the light.
I was out of the
everlasting darkness.
I had never been so
happy.
I felt I could do
anything anywhere.
There were no limits.
The world was mine
to take.
I was so happy.
While expressing
myslef, in this
strange new world I
had discovered,
I must&#39;v gone too far.
In a split second I
lost all my feelings&#39;n
sense of happiness...
My dream was torn down

Back to the industrial
style...
