 <info>Notes from 505:
&#34;A tribute to the great Silly Venture Atari party series in Gdansk, Poland - which hopefully is going to be continued one day.

Tracked with Renoise, sample based and using 4 channels as I intended to convert it to Protracker format at some point.&#34;

Released on the [url]chiptuneswin.com[/url] bandcamp release volume 4:
