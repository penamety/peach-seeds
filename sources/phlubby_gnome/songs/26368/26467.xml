 <info>Lyrics:

Another day is a waste of your life, she said
I can&#39;t wander looking for your dream today
One two a river unseen by the waste in your life

Another break in your way is a sign, she says
I look forward, watch you eat your words today
Run to the look in your darkened eyes
Still they&#39;re alive

Another day is a step towards grey, she says
I just wonder if she&#39;ll ever be today
Run to the winter cold embrace
Stealing my life

Another running away is your sign, she says
I look forward, watch the sky recede today
One two a fateful turn away
Sealing our lives

I&#39;m lost in your eyes again
Once I met your gaze
And find the way
The way to be cold again</info>
