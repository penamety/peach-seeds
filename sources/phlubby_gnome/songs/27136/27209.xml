 <info>The music played during the introduction on the Amiga is titled &#34;git5&#34;. When the author was asked the meaning of this title, he simply replied &#34;The title git5 was just something quick and easy to type, as I had made loads of tunes over a few months when I first got some tracker software, and was running out of short titles to store them as. So git5 was next on the list.&#34;</info>
