There is a party where we&#39;re all gonna be,
Just bring your friends and some joyful memories
You&#39;re gonna like it there my friends, trust in me,
Come follow me now, down to BITLive 3

Come, follow me!
Follow me back in time!

C64 play my favourite melodies,
Play it on cd, mc, mp3
Everybody set the 8-bit spirit free,
Enjoy yourself down at BITLive 3

Come, follow me!
Follow me back in time!</info>
