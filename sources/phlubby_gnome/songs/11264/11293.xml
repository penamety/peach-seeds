Lyrics:
I wasn&#39;t born Richard Alpert. I was just born as a human being. And then I learned this whole business of who I am, and whether I&#39;m good or bad, or achieving or not. All that&#39;s learned along the way. 2x

And, you see all those learned things separate, so you start to have this dissociative experience, of where all that you become is a point of awareness, that&#39;s all that&#39;s left. I remember the first time this happened to me, I got this terrible panic, because indeed, I was gonna cease to exist.</info>
