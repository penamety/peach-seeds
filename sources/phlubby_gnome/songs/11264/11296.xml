Lyrics:

I can feel the poison running through my veins
I failed my mission to become a wicked saint
I grew the mistake to the point of no return
I ate forbidden fruits, now I&#39;ve got to learn

Oh, my whole existence comes and says good bye
I feel so lonely and so cold, I think that I will die
In all these years I&#39;ve never been so deep inside my head
I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;m awake or if I&#39;m already dead

Life, I need it, I breathe it, I need to show
Life, I have it, I got it, I&#39;ve got to know
Life, I take it, I earn it, I need it so
Life, I grab it, I hold it, I don&#39;t let go

I&#39;m like an animal, hungry on it&#39;s way to home
my spirit burned out, down to skin and bones
I am possessed, I feel no power or control
I got lost for salvation, I have sold my soul

I realize my ego has been worthless
My life is perforated with sheer disturbedness
Like turtle without shell, I crawl away from hell
Degenerating into a future that I cannot tell</info>
