 <info>This is *NOT* AY! I used this category only because there&#39;s no corner for Spectrum&#39;s Z80 chip sound. 

ZX Spectrum 48K chiptune (Z80 chip). 

This is a chiptune with sound-quality of ONE BIT (sound turn-on, sound turn-off, nothing more). Generated by Z80 chip with ULA chip as a transducer. 

This editor (Orfeus) makes from original hardware one channel of square wave without any volume control -  3 channels, in a way of software mixing, adding envelopes and simulating volume&#39;s changes.

However, like they wrote on 8BC, this is a tune for TWO beepers - for two synchronized Spectrums48. :) 

Which gives 6 channels. </info>
