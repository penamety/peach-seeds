I can feel them coming in the dead of night
For a lost patrol too weakened to last through a fight.
Bombs blazing, lighting up the sky.

I can hear them closing in the deadly hour
On the lost patrol, so weak all they can do is cower.
Sniper gazing, deciding who&#39;s to die.

As the end is drawing near
With the light of dawn I shed a tear
For those who&#39;ve gone.

I can see them firing at us from afar,
A lost patrol who don&#39;t quite know where they are.

As the end is drawing near
With the light of dawn I shed a tear
For those who&#39;ve gone.
