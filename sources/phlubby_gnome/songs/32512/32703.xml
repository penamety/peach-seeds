 <info>1) I was bored.
2) I refuse to use square wave for leads. The song has been made on ZX Spectrum 48K with AY-interface. It is a 3-channels generator based on square waves. It has additional &#34;buzzers&#34; but they&#39;re designed mostly for bass. Therefore everybody use squares as leads on AY, which is boring. Still, it&#39;s most annoying to tune the &#34;buzzers&#34; in higher frequencies to make them sound like some funny leads. But I keep experimenting for many years: what more can be pulled-out from AY without additional CPU&#39;s activity (like it&#39;s being done on Atari ST for example). Hence I use only original possibilities of AY chip. And now I&#39;m going to smoke some cherry tobacco. Greetz, ppl.</info>
