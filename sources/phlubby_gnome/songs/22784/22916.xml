 <info>Back in the Shire is a remix of Anders Knatten&#39;s song by the same name. The original had a slower, more pop-inspired arrangement, but I wanted to juice it up and made this trance version that became quite popular during the 1999 &#34;spring break&#34; (russetid) at PoC&#39;s school.</info>
