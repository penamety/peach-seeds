The E.R. Shuffle

the First Ever Groovy Compo Entry from Virt (sound of crickets chirping)

-------------------------------------------

Okay, I swore off compos, but this one is too big to pass up (And from what I heard, a lot of fun.) Whoever told me that latter part was right! Whee! A whole week to track!

Of course, being the obsessive prick that I am, I started on it Sunday at noon and finished it Sunday at 9. Ugh.

I hope you enjoy it - this one&#39;s made with motion in mind, so get up off your ass and dance! :) And TRY not to die while you dance, because we don&#39;t want a repeat of what&#39;s inside this tune! 

-(Hello to all whom I don&#39;t yet know; hopefully this&#39;ll be a good chance to meet someone new :)
