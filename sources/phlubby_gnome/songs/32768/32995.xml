 <info>Hi Freaks…I hope you are enjoying the Sound of Scenesat Vol II…Welcome to the French section of this compilation. This track was composed for the streaming compo of the Revision Demoparty (my first European demoparty…Never too late ;) eh ? So why &#34;ElectroRocket&#34; ? Maybe some of you have already listened to my Amiga Remixes ? If the answer is &#34;yes&#34; then this sound will be familiar…I like to mix Electronic and Acoustic sounds, so, with the guitar it is a mix of Electronic and Rock music…ElectroRock…ElectroRockET because the music describes the takeoff, the exploration, and the landing of a rocket: I promise I haven&#39;t smoked anything :) :) :) 
So the idea was to start the music with a cozy sound, then move to the rock part, go back to the electronic sound, and finish with the melody of the intro with a rock arrangement. 
You like the concept ? This is &#34;The ElectroRocket&#34;…Well now I want to send some shout outs to all the people involved in this project…All these people who have contributed to bring together this amazing product…Isn&#39;t it really cool ? It reminds me the good old time and yeah… it&#39;s magical ! .......... And thanks to Andrea for being so cool ...</info>
