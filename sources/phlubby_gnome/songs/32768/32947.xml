 <info>Someone (Alex) asked me, if i can make a remix of first samurai.
 i start to remix the track, and i think the drums of first samurai is a big part that we remember.
 I use the original drums from the amiga in this remix too. 
i have remix the completly track but i think is is too long for the CD. 
I make 2 Versions of it. The SHOIRT Edit and the Extended Edit.
 I hope i can made someone happy with this remix of First Samurai except Alex. 

I hope you understand my broken english.

nice greets from germany.
