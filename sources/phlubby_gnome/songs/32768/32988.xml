 <info>Timbral was playing a cool oldschool 
live set at Evoke 2010. I liked it quite a bit, so I had to go and download 
some more of his music from the net. 
A 2010 live set of his had 
this strangely named, fun and catchy tune that started playing in 
my head every now and then. 


When you play a chiptune in your head, at some point
 your imagination kind of starts adding elements to it, breaking
 the technical limitations of the original chip. (Or that&#39;s 
what happens to me anyway.) 
Eventually I decided I might as
 well compose this remix in FL Studio and play it from the speakers
 instead of just the brain. Here you go.</info>
