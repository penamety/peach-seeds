 <info>This tune was intended to be released on a compilation from Geomagnetic.tv some time ago. Everything was looking good, I sent the track off to mastering, spoke some with the mastering technician etc. Time went by, the compilation was &#34;in production&#34; I was told. Finally, the CD was released. I checked the track-list, and what do you know; my track was not on it. Turns out it was dropped, and I was the last one to be told.... Enough ranting :) 
This track draws influences from quite a lot of genres and tracks I&#39;ve listened to through the years. Trancy pads, 303s, synth stab piano, stuff like that. Combined with the distobeats and daggidaggi bassline I think it turned out quite nice.</info>
