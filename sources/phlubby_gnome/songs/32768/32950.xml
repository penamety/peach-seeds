 <info>There isn&#39;t really much to say about &#34;21 September&#34;.
I wanted to do something different from the norm and to remove some dust from one of my hardware synths.
So, basically, i did an atmospheric electro-minimal track; most of the sounds come out from the Virus C synth and it was sequenced in Ableton Live; about 2 afternoons of work.
Hope you like it!</info>
