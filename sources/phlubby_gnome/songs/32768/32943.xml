 <info>Hugs and Love from Denmark to everyone who needs it. Just keep your pants on. Unless it is during a democompetition. Then it&#39;s PANTS OFF!! ;)
This track is probably one of the better ones from me (at least melody-wise). However the mastering could be better because I suck huge ass when it comes to mastering tracks. :(       Anyway, this particulary track is dedicated to a special friend of mine. This one is for you, Lan Bai. :)  It is weird to write some text for scroller. I haven&#39;t done this since the good old days in the 80&#39;s when I made demos on the C64. :P  Somehow I think it was easier to write a lot of nonsense back then. We had a lot more imagination at the time and did not have to create amazing 3D effects and shit. ;)  Well, I think that this is the end of this text.  Enjoy the rest of this tune if it is possible.  But you must surely enjoy the rest of this awesome music disk.  </info>
