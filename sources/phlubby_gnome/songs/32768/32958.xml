 <info>Hello everyone, this is Martin &#34;Mantronix&#34; Wall, and I believe while reading this you are listening to my composition &#34;Neutron Chase&#34;. This song is actually based on a composition that I did in my Amiga days, but never managed to get down into Protracker. Now it is expanded and refined with modern audio equipment of today. For me it has been a very long while, around 17-18 years since I last released something to the scene community. I guess you could say that other things in life took over for me, like it naturally does for most people. But I am now in a better position with at least a little time to devote to composing, and I have recently set up a small home studio for this purpose. There may very well be more releases further along the road. Since the dawn of Facebook I have followed all the scene activity still going on, and it is great to see all the great people still doing amazing stuff. Greetz to Ziphoid (for inviting me to SceneSat) and to Firefox (for mastering work on the track). Also I must say hello to a few fellow scene sceners or musicians: 4mat, Jogeir Liljedahl, Dubmood, Moby, Raphael Gesqua, Alex Strohm, Magnar, Mahoney, Klaus Lunde, Aleksi Eeben, Rez, Crown, Reynald Deliens and Romeo Knight.</info>
