 <info>I&#39;d like to thank all the members of the Scenesat community. You are the reason why Scenesat is filled with pleasure, happiness and joy. I can&#39;t think of a better place than Scenesat.
 You can chillout, share you music opinion with other people, and listen to some great tunes. 
This community is getting better by the minute, and you are all the reason why Scenesat is the place to be.
 Through the years Scenesat has been discovered by many artists. But there are still artists out there who doesn&#39;t know about Scenesat&#39;s whereabout. 
So why don&#39;t we all shout out to crowd and tell them about our lovely community.
 Love is a matter of trust. I would also like to dedicate this song to my lovely girlfriend, who has always been there for me, through the good times and the bad.</info>
