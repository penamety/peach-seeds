<br />Additional Information:<br /><i><p>Welcome to this little synth track called &#34;Time&#34;. Time is something we never seem to have enough of. Which is why this track never ended up sounding like it was meant to be. As a true spacesynth track. But I guess I never had the time to figure out how to create a 100% spacesynth track. ;)<br />Lots of love to the website <a href="http://spacesynth.net">spacesynth.net</a>..  A lot of awesome spacesynth artists lurks around there. In my opinion there is not enough spacesynth being played in the radio these day. The standard mainstream music in the FM radios is just plain awful. I have actually only heard a spacesynth track in the national FM radio here in DK once. And that was a million years ago (or pretty close). That track was &#34;Jabdah by Koto&#34; and it got me so hooked in to this music genre that I have loved it ever since.   Spacesynth FTW!!</p></i>
