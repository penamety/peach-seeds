Made using ableton 6, quite a fair few vsti&#39;s including a vanguard, z3ta and that sort of thing. Yet more cut up drumloops i&#39;ve got floating about and more beer (beer is always very important in these operations).

It&#39;s basically my little journey through a genre that I dont really touch on much anymore and came around entirely by accident (especially the final section which you &#34;Might&#34; recognise from somewhere else) .. I quite enjoyed making it so hopefully you&#39;ll enjoy listening to it. 

Shouts to everyone at scene sat, remix 64, retro remakes, alex aris, ovine, retrospec, psytronik, all the spanish remakers ive worked with who&#39;s names are too numerous and well.. spanish for my pathetic english brain to remember (but they know who they are), my friends on facebook, anyone thats a fan, my twitter buddies, dan franklin, bassline junkie, anyone who has ever supported the scene, and even those that don&#39;t and this time I&#39;ll add all my family and friends and especially Donella who without her sunny disposition I would definitely be a much more angry man (And if you&#39;ve ever read some of my facebook/twitter rants you&#39;ll know the idea of me being more angry is quite a scary prospect). </info>
