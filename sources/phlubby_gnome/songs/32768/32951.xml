 <info>Heh, what to say. It&#39;s been a loooong time since I did ANY scene related work. The task to create a track for this great compilation came really refreshing. Throwing away the commercial based music routine approach, I was free to let the track take it&#39;s natural course from the first chord. Although it was heavily inspired by the recent TRON soundtrack (I&#39;m sure you noticed ;)) I didn&#39;t want to constrain myself in any way, and just let it come together in this hybrid kind of way. Although utilizing symphonic elements with electronica is nothing new, I just like both worlds. Now mixing and orchestrating this was a bit of pain in the ass, since I don&#39;t really have much experience with it. But it was a fun and creative process overall. Thanks to Ziphoid and the SceneSat crew for making this possible! Hope to see you in another great project. Signing off. //Dafunk</info>
