 <info>Lots of fun writing this track, wanted something hard for the first song in the new album. Everything was done in FL Studio 9, synth work is entirely FL plugins. :) Guitar is my own fender strat which was multisampled (cause I really can&#39;t play!) and run through the free JCM900 amp simulator VST. Mastered the track with Buzzroom&#39;s BuzMaxi3 and BCL201 which are excellent dynamics VSTs. Vocals were recorded through my laptop&#39;s built-in mic, it&#39;s terrible but I don&#39;t have any recording equipment. :P Greets to everyone in Titan, I haven&#39;t forgotten you! Also greets to everyone involved in the C64 scene, after over 25 years you guys are still discovering fascinating things to do with it! :) If you like this track you can always check out the other stuff at Sanxion7.com - free album downloads :)</info>
