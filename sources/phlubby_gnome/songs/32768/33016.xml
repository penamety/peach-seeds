 <info>A track for you to take with you next time you hit the (virtual) road into distant lands with your favorite spinning cube&#39;ehicle. Apologies for my complete lack of imagination for coming up with a better text scroller. You&#39;re supposed to enjoy the tunes and not read stuff!! :P By the way, I&#39;m looking for a group or individuals that are in need of a musician for their demo projects, if you got anything going please send an email to: demoscene@sunspire-records.com or look me up in #scenesat on EFNet.
SunSpire would like to greet all fellow demosceners, all people at AmigaRemix, RKO, Nectarine, Bitfellas, BTTR, and especially all folks at SceneSat Radio. Keep on making these tunes and keep the scene alive!!!!! Even more greetings must go to Kaomau, Sentcool, JoeyAngel, Watercolor, Gureckima, Arvenius and all the zillion people I forgot to mention!! :)</info>
