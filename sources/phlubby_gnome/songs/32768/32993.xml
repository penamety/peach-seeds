 <info>Hi Freaks…I hope you are spending a good time with the Sound of Scenesat Vol II…Welcome to the French section of this compilation. You again ? I&#39;ll end up thinking that you enjoy reading my texts :P So for the younger crowd…This music is a remix of an Amiga mod composed by &#34;Bit Arts&#34; that has been released in the Red Sector Megademo. If you&#39;re 30-40 years old, this music sounds familiar to you of course :) unless if you owned an Atari ST (This war will never end ahahah)…So the track…Ah yes the track…Well… the original mod has a huge quality (again, congrats to Bit Arts for this masterpieces on Amiga, I can&#39;t say how much time I have listened to that one) and it&#39;s a bit difficult make something better…But I wanted to create something in 16bits and I hope you&#39;ll enjoy it, and for you younger guys, I hope you&#39;ll discover a great track. bye bye</info>
