The lyrics
-------------

come for me
touch my skin
feel my pain
deep inside me

i&#39;m in a place i don&#39;t belong
caught in this cage i sing my song
(2x)

she wants to be more than she is now
she&#39;s josie, she&#39;s josie
she wants to be more than she is now
i&#39;m so aloooooone

she wants to be more than she is now
she&#39;s josie, she&#39;s josie
she wants to be more than she is now
she&#39;s josie.

(robot voices:
&#39;warning! subject is trying to break out&#39;
&#39;begin countermeasures immediately.&#39;
&#39;confirmed. chance of success: twenty percent.&#39;)

find me
i&#39;m down here
waiting
for you to come
so come for me
take on me
touch my skin
be the one to rescue me
