 <info>Lyrics: 

A lonely warm mid-August night, on the streets of old downtown,
I&#39;m watching the red-green neon lights and get lost inside the sound.
But I just want to take you in my arms and go dance the night away,
so I follow the masses and drink lots of glasses and forget about today.

Refrain:

It is just Party Night under the pale moon light,
it is just Party Night and I keep on searching for you.
It is still Party Night under the electric light,
it is still Party Night and I got to spend it with you.

I&#39;m walking slowly thru traffic lights and the smell of gasoline,
I&#39;m travelling, I&#39;m circling subway lines to stations I&#39;ve never been.
But I just want to keep you in my heart for the rest of all my days,
so I follow the cars along the great boulevards and go blow my mind away!

8) Yeah baby, I got to find you, on the streets of this lonely town.
Somehow, some way, I&#39;ll get to you, tonight! 8)

Refrain:

It is just Party Night under the pale moon light,
it is just Party Night and I keep on searching for you.
It is still Party Night under the electric light,
it is still Party Night and I got to spend it with you.

I remember the special evening I saw your face the last time (the last time).
Your eyes were flashing like strobo lights and love was in your smile (in your smile).
But I just couldn&#39;t stay, I ran away, there were other things to do (other things to do).
Few minutes later I felt the pain inside, I couldn&#39;t sleep because of you, because of you!</info>
