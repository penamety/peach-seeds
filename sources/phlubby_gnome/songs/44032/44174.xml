 <info>Perhaps the first &#34;chipmod&#34; ever. At least one of the very first ones among old 4mat chip modules. Done before August 1989 but the exact date is not known.

[code]switch are proud to 	
present their latest 	
invention # synthetic 	
waveforms for st # 	
we hope that you like 	
it and besides that 	
that you enjoy it. 	
for that&#39;s the main 	
reason why we make 	
music. the (samples) 	
found in this song 	
were mostly distilled 	
from public sources 	
so please don&#39;t rip 	
them yourselves you 	
mostlikely already 	
keep them in your own 	
private (messed-up) 	
sample lib&#39;s (plst&#39;s) 
we always enjoy 	
looking into your 	
plst&#39;s (from the st- 	
compacts that we get) 	
and are amused by 	
the names that you 
baptize your samples 	
with. we even saw the 	
samples that we used 	
for paranoimia. but 	
then again who cares. 	
we don&#39;t expect reply[/code]</info>
