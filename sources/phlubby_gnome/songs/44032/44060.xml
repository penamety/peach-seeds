 <info>Friendly fire
Friendly fire
Friendly fire

All I ever hoped, all I ever asked
Was a piece of love from you but now it is all passed
Now I&#39;m on my own, and I feel alone
That&#39;s all right as long as I remember what we&#39;ve ???
I think you believe in everything but me
I know that you can&#39;t express the many things you see
So come with me, burning flames

Friendly fire
Take me higher on your friendly fire
Give me some more of your friendly fire
Take me higher on your friendly fire
Give me some more of your friendly fire

When the time has come and you&#39;re on the run
Run away from all the things and deeds you&#39;ve never done
But you still deny every single lie
You pretend that self-deception gives you wings to fly
It is hard to breathe when you are a thief
All the stolen feelings could just never heal your grief
So come with me, burning flames

Friendly fire
Take me higher on your friendly fire
Give me some more of your friendly fire
Take me higher on your friendly fire
Give me some more of your friendly fire

Big bright burning lights glittering shimmer in the night
I believe in everything you do
When the night has come, and your baby&#39;s on the run
Realise the one and only ???

Friendly fire
Take me higher on your friendly fire
Give me some more of your friendly fire
Take me higher on your friendly fire
Give me some more of your friendly fire

Big bright burning lights glittering shimmer in the night
I believe in everything you do
When the night has come, and your baby&#39;s on the run
Realise the one and only ???
In you
