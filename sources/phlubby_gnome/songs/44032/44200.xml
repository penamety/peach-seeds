 <info>This is the xm version version 1.0 of Cassiopeia, 16 channels, done in Milkytracker, extended about 1:30min just for fun.

Some Background information: Originally, I did a one minute .xm of Cassiopeia first, *then* made a 4 minute studio version in Cubase based on that one minute xm module ,   and just thought, why not finish the xm module now as well, plus a few additons and also a bit extended, so here it is!

If you want, you can give me some feedback (oneliner or PM or email or something), and I could update the track a bit, based on your feedback. Cheers :)</info>
