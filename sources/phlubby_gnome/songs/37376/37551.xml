Electro-house thingofajig I made a few months ago. Heavily influenced by A_Rival, so he deserves credit for the style of this song.
Composed in Famitracker v0.3.7 (2A03 + VRC6). Stereo automation done in post. Visualizations via MIDITrail.

Originally this was only intended for my live NES chiptune DJ set during &#34;Hardware Girls Night 3&#34;, hence the &#34;original mix&#34;-style repetition for the intro/outro. I wasn&#39;t planning to release it beyond that. As with my typical &#34;make TOTALLY DANZ UNTZ the night before lol!!!!!!!&#34; routine for every live set I&#39;m invited to, I composed this in a few hours within the wee morning before having to bail for the venue @ Shibuya. Yes, including the vocals. It kinda shows with the ridiculous &#34;lyrics&#34;. :D
