 <info>From the music disk &#34;blur plastiq&#34;, ftp://ftp.scene.org/mirrors/hornet/music/disks/1996/fm-plast.zip.  Notes from Mellow-D:

        Very much rougher than the rest of the stuff.  I actually
        turn down the amplification in FT2 because this is a bit
        overdriven :). More filters in the leads.

        Heh, do you hear that panning feedback thing?  Me and Mig
        made that by plugging a mic into my effects processor,
        plugging that into his set of analog effects, and going
        (just once) &#34;ha&#34; into the microphone. No kidding. Wow.

        This song has basically let off a lot of steam I had at
        the time.
