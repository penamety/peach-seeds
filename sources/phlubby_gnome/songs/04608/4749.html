		<p>From the musicdisk &#34;two years&#34;...<br />=================================</p>

<p>just a quick informal info file..</p>

<p>wow, two years!  march 1995 -&gt; march 1997 .. and still going.  bear<br />with us here, i dont think we had any idea the group would last this<br />long. =)</p>

<p>we would just like to thank everyone who has supported our music over<br />the group&#39;s inception (and before when we were running around in other<br />various groups trying to be heard.. =)).. and all your mail to the<br />list *is read*, even if not replied to and we appreciate it all..</p>

<p>we don&#39;t know how much longer the group will be together (no, we don&#39;t<br />SEE an end in sight but we are all becoming increasingly busy with our<br />lives outside the computer so who knows what the future will bring.)</p>

<p>that&#39;s about it, bye for now, all..</p>

<p>by the way, sorry for the lack of interface.. we&#39;re just keeping<br />with that trend we started off with =) we may have some interface<br />disks coming up in the next half-a-year or so, thanks to the offers<br />of help from legend design and imphobia members willing to help us<br />out on the coding and graphics end of it. </p>

<p>additionally, our homepage.. http://www.fm.org/ has been someone<br />neglected over the past several months but we plan to get it up<br />to date VERY soon. meanwhile you can get all of our releases<br />on ftp.cdrom.com .. use the search engine on http://www.hornet.org/<br />and you will be able to find them all there.</p>

<p>regards to everyone out there...</p>
