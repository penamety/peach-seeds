 <info>From the music disk &#34;blur plastiq&#34;, ftp://ftp.scene.org/mirrors/hornet/music/disks/1996/fm-plast.zip.  Notes from Mellow-D:

        See yourself as an angel.  This was done when I was
        still living in Brussels (I live in Finland again now).
        We went to see Seven with a bunch of friends, and when I
        got back home I started to track.  What a fantastic movie
        and what an inspiration!

        The sound is intentionally as it is.  The sound actually
        reminds me of a VERY dusty room with the walls in very
        bad shape, and everything has turned yellow from all the
        cigarette and other smoke.

        Made in summer 96, this song was also greatly inspired
        by Front 242.  The vocals aren&#39;t me again, they&#39;ve been
        sampled in a random sampling session, FROM THE RADIO :)
        I got lucky.
