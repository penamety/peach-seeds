     Greetings all...

     This song was originally my entry for GroovyCompo 2, but I missed
     the deadline and the song was never released (or quite finished,
     for that matter).

     But here it is, just as I left it.  I felt it was good enough to
     release, even though it is so short.  It&#39;s a short download though.

     All samples are by Hunz.









     Bye now
