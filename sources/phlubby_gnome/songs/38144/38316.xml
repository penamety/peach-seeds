His steely skin is covered
By centuries of dust
Once he was a great one
Now he&#39;s dull and rust

An oily tear he&#39;s crying
Can you feel the pain
Of the sad, sad robot
And it&#39;s driving him insane

He can&#39;t turn back time nor history
So his life became a misery
He has to face the destiny
Nobody cares anymore

Sad, sad robot (3x)
All alone

He&#39;s a sad, sad robot (3x)
He&#39;s so alone

Me steely skin is covered
By centuries of dust
Once me was a great one
But now I&#39;m dull and rust

An oily tear I&#39;m crying
Can you feel me pain
I&#39;m the sad, sad robot
Driving me insane

I cant turn back time nor history
So me life became a misery
I have to face me destiny
That I&#39;m all on me own

Sad, sad robot
I&#39;m a sad, sad robot (2x)
All alone

Oh, I&#39;m a sad, sad robot
I&#39;m a sad, sad robot (2x)
I&#39;m all alone

Sad, sad robot (3x)
All alone

You&#39;re a sad, sad robot (3x)
You&#39;re so alone

Red, red robot
I&#39;m a red, red robot (2x)
And so I shall return

I&#39;m a red, red robot (3x)
So I shall return</info>
