 <info>Not a game music or film soundtrack this time, but a music I started to compose myself as soon as I heard a little piece of oriental music while walking on a street.

Some new and fresh ideas in this song, mainly inspired from the oriental and &#34;space-sounding&#34; instruments I&#39;ve used in it.

As a result, &#34;Arabian Feelings&#34; can be considered considered as a combination of oriental and space-sounding melodies, some parts of them having also been inspired from an excellent music track by Karsten Koch, named &#34;Jupiter&#39;s Orbit&#34;.</info>
