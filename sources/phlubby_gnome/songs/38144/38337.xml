 <info>Along with &#34;Arabian Feelings&#34;, this song remains one of my favourites among all my personal works.

Just like with &#34;Arabian Feelings&#34;, I tried to split this song into several parts, either by using different instruments, or by covering different registers.

If I had to credit someone who inspired me parts of this song, it would be, once again, Karsten Koch, with his excellent &#34;Hidden Empire&#34; track. If you like my song, you may also like his one, so, try it out!</info>
