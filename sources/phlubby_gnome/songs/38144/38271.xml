 <info>At some point I wanted to start my own group. Never did. This was released via the modarchive before the web crash.

Apparently I wanted to call the group &#34;ScoreSTe&#34;.

At the time I was pretty ticked with the Trideja gang.

I got over it. A few years later I retired.

Now I&#39;m back.</info>
