 <info>Here is my second release of year 2006, and, once again, a new tune from a computer game, this game being &#34;Operation Stealth&#34;, released as &#34;James Bond: The Stealth Affair&#34; in the US, during the early 90s.

This music is the &#34;underwater theme&#34; of the game, and is mainly inspired by the PC/MS-DOS/AdLib version of the original game soundtrack, although it has also been inspired by the Amiga version.</info>
