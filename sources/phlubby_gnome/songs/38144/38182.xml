Heya everyone, I hope you enjoyed my little song,
Inspired devinely as a mix of heavy metal with
that futuristic sound you get from playing F-Zero,
and just a hint of jap style reminiscent of Super
Valis 4. The song is called &#34;Silence&#34; because it
sounds like Silence from F-Zero! I hope you enjoyed it!

Greets fly out to these people:

RaN, for without him I would think I am not progressing.
RxEx, because I taught him how to track :)
The Nuke, because he has reviewed most of my music,
The Shad0w, because this is the stuff he goes for!
K-Styles, who does music for my games and it sounds nice!
And finally, SEPH ! Thanks for the anime faces man!!
