 <info>Hi everyone!  I am back, and I got a new song I made in just 4 hours!
I hope you enjoy this little peice, it sounds quite odd does it not?
I like it a lot, and I dedicate it to all the clickers out there I know!
The tune was supposed to be a cafe tune for a game, but it didn&#39;t quite
sound like it, and I said &#34;This reminds me of the Click Cafe&#34; and there!
Is my title.  Hope you enjoyed the song everyone,

-Nobuyuki
