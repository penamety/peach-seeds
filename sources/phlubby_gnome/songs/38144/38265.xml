By Fearofdark
Finished: 29th August 2009

A song to express my fustraition at this present time. Oddly, inspired by the Po
kemon
Platinum battle scene against one of the legendary pokemon (no mocking, it&#39;s a g
ood game!)
Made in only a couple of days;...whoa! I&#39;m speedy:D

Samples from aceman and K.Koch, and others from various artists.

You know who you are...oh, and enjoy!

(also, my first chiptune that doesn&#39;t really use any guitar or synth samples:) T
he strings
in this one are unused, and sorry that the ending&#39;s a bit sudden, i&#39;m never good
 at
endings:P)</info>
