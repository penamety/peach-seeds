 <info>I was born between factory walls.
I was conceived among the ivory halls;
And in this world I knew my role.
I went to work with a single goal.
I travelled the Earth to far-off lands,
From the Asian jungles to the African sands.
I flew in planes of camouflage green
Before I settled upon this scene.
Like a shooting star, I came to rest,
And this farmer&#39;s field is where I nest,
Watching the seasons come and go,
Watching the long grass grow and grow.

The years pass by and I lay here still,
For my purpose is clear for me to fulfil.
The sun was out, it was the middle of May
When the farmer&#39;s three children came out to play.
They ventured near; I lay in wait.
One unknowing step sealed their fate.
One thousand shards of plastic rose
From where I lay and through their clothes,
Into their bodies the shrapnel sank,
Here in this field, by a river bank.
The blood poured down, shone in the sun,
And one cluster bomblet&#39;s job was done.
