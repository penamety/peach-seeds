 <info>Ok, this one actually has a story behind it: It was inspired by a song that must have been popular among turkish youngsters in cologne at that time. I remember hearing it being played loud in a red car (a BMW maybe) while waiting at a traffic light. I kept the main theme and made one expectionally great rave remix out of it ... ;)</info>
