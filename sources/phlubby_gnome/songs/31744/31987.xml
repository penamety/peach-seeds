 <info>This is a vocoder version of One More Time.

It took a lot of work to be done, both because of poor recording conditions and because it is the first track in which I made vocoder vocals.

Recording the vocals wasn&#39;t that problematic, each verse took a few attempts, but that was OK. The horrible nit-picking part was syncing the vocoder notes to the vocal track. That was very exhausting and took a lot of trial-and-error hours. It still isn&#39;t perfect, but the quality is good enough, I think.

That being said, I made a huge leap forward, for this is really the first track where I incorporated my own vocals, and at the same time the first track where I made proper use of a vocoder as such.

Frankly, I don&#39;t want to see this song for a little while
