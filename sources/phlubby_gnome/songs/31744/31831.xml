 <info>On the sixth day, God created man.
And on the seventh day, man created war.

Steel (??? goes) in my heart.
It&#39;s shining just like chrome.
Lipless faces ??? take me home.
See the souls depart in never-ending swarm.
Affection and embraces, death will keep us warm.
You can go no further until you repent.
Devil, angels, god are not exempt.
See the souls that march, and death is turning cold.
Where&#39;s the promised land from the stories of old?
Lose &#39;em, friend and foe, your bitterness, your pride.
There is nothing left for you; come into the light.
Come undo my life (??? peril) in disguise
There&#39;s nowhere to run; time to come undone.
Come undo my life (??? peril) in disguise
There&#39;s nowhere to hide; time to take a ride.
Take me away, take me away with you.
Take me away, take me away with you.
Take me away, take me away with you.
Take me away, take me away with you.
Come fulfil my death; let me draw my final breath.
Come let me behold the land from the stories of old
Land from the stories of old
Land from the stories of old
Land from the stories of old
Land from the stories of old
As the stories they told.

Come undo my life (??? peril) in disguise
There&#39;s nowhere to run, time to come undone.

Come fulfil my death; let me draw my final breath.

Take me away, take me away with you.
Take me away, take me away with you.

Land from the stories of old
Land from the stories of old
As the stories they told.
