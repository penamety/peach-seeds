 <info>This is the second italo track after &#34;One More Time&#34; done in the style of Michiel van der Kuy&#39;s vocal production from the 80s/90s.

This time also more experimentation with the bass, and with the drumkit as well. Especially the drumkit is quite elaborate and took a lot of time to make.

Once more I got a bit closer to the style I am after, and that was the goal after all.

I don&#39;t have full lyrics written yet for this piece, but I already have something to start from, so I hope for a vocoder and/or vocal version as well.
