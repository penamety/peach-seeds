 <info>[i]Lyrics:
I want to give you so much
When you need so few
Why is it so hard when all i want
Is to simply be with you

So close and so far
So smooth, so hard
My joy can&#39;t be more intense
When we&#39;re alone together

My stellar romance
Supernova in silence

Sensitive moments
Peacefull and quiet
I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re unreachable
In spite of the distance
I feel unstoppable

I always tell you my love
When you need nothing
Why are you so blue when all i want
Is to stop the waiting

I don&#39;t know how long i could stand
But i guess i&#39;ll keep trying again.[/i]</info>
