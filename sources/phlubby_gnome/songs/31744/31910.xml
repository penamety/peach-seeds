 <info>This great mod was inspired by the so-called Deep Dance series that was popular with me and my friends in the early 90s. It&#39;s a medley of about 20 (I never counted) eurodance songs that we all loved so much.  And there&#39;s a hidden parts hidden in it as well. Can you ear-spot it? This mod also includes some stolen (just borrowed!) samples from other Amiga mods.</info>
