 <info>Techno/chip-piece composed for intro-purposes, but I do not remember it being made for a specific one. The filesize is way too big for a chiptune anyway, but the song is not &#34;stripped&#34; or optimized to preserve space.

I remember having read a magazine with many rude jokes right before starting to track this piece, hence the name &#34;Groovie Jokes&#34;.</info>
