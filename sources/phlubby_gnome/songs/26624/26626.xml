Lyrics:
Before I can catch you, you&#39;re slipping my grip
In plain sight you vanish mysterious creep
Green, blue and yellow like a rainbow strip
You&#39;re changing a million colors

Familiar allure, there is nothing to see
A play of the senses you put on for me
To have and to hold is to lose and regret
You&#39;re making this all too easy

I come to your nightmares, you come to my dreams
It feels like it&#39;s heaven made out of our sins
As coal turns to diamond undone come the seams
I&#39;m tangled in this confusion

Come too close
Then run away
Don&#39;t know who&#39;s hiding
If I am just finding
This treacherous nasty
Chameleon behaviour of yours

I&#39;ve learned to interpret your playful intent
But still you surprise me, and you don&#39;t relent
I think of escaping and then I repent
You&#39;re turning into addiction

The reasons are something you keep to yourself
And all of our moments I keep on a shelf
As I step on forward you take two steps back
And back as I go.. you follow

Come too close
And stay some more
Feeling I&#39;m hunted
And taking for granted
This perverted shifty
Chameleon behaviour of yours

Admitting my feelings again is so quaint
Like all of those colours you won&#39;t let me paint
Green, blue and yellow the canvas is faint
And lacking determination

If you&#39;re only playing, I can&#39;t let you win
My intent is as focused as always has been
I might not escape your appeal and your charm
But I am chameleon also

Can&#39;t get close
Insecure
The fountains of effort
I&#39;m putting on your fort
Transcending my conscience
And try to convince you to
Come too close
And stay just there
I&#39;m not not even hiding
It&#39;s all about fighting
For getting rid of this
Chameleon behaviour of yours </info>
