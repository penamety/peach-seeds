 <info>Lyrics:
We want to tell about a better place
The most marvelous thing you&#39;ll ever face
Endless wonders that never cease to amaze
Beyond imagination, beyond imagination!

A portal will soon open in the garden
It will lead us to our promised haven
This is your destiny as women and men
Enter the next level, enter the next level

We try to save people from misery
Come with us we say to the infinity!
But it&#39;s no use... they just repeat:
I must continue! Must continue!

No one else is yet ready to evolve
If we want the bliss... we must go alone!
We now say goodbye to all the flesh &amp; bone
It was nice to know you! It was nice to know you!</info>
