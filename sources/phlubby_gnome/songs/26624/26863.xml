 <info>Actually, it was Slaygon that dragged me into doing this remix in the first place. He visited The Church when he did his European roundtrip. While he was in the Netherlands we thought it would be nice if we did a late night Sunday Service impromptu....

He asked me to do a rendition of Green Beret, but I said I wasn&#39;t too sure since I didn&#39;t knew the song that well. But after some pushing and hessitation I took the challange and the basis of this remix and improvisation was born.

For fun I later recorded another 10-minute live-version with some camera&#39;s which you can still see at YouTube if you want:

After quiet some request for an &#39;audio&#39;-version I made some cuts here and there and tried to mix this 6-minute version as good as I could get it. And here is the result.

I hope you&#39;ll enjoy it!

Cheers,

Reyn.</info>
