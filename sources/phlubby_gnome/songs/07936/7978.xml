I can still hear my mother yell, &#34;Son! Time for bed!&#34; -- and I&#39;d put my pyjamas on, brush my teeth, and go to bed. But then I&#39;d hear something in the dark: I would hear my computer talking to me. It would say, &#34;Come on, dude! Just one more mission.

You search the taste of steel as you watch them burn and die.
Slaying your virtual foe, you leave them where they lie.
It&#39;s easy to be mean when death equals a high score screen
And hell on earth spells game over.

No time for innocence when death comes swift and cold.
Berserk in the night, blood is your goal.
It&#39;s easy to be mean when death equals a high score screen
And hell on earth spells game over.

You can take your Quake and go away:
I won&#39;t play it anyway.

The graphics might be blocky, but so what?

The feeling is bad, music is rad:
Not much more to ask for or say.
The games of my childhood will stay.
