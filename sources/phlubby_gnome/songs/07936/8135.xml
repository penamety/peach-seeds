 <info>Lyrics:
Now is the time to say how much I really love you, baby
Show me the sign, and I will stay with you all through the night
When we&#39;re apart I spend each moment thinking of you, baby
You&#39;re in my heart - I&#39;ll always keep you close and hold you tight

You remember first time we met - how I told you
I had to make you mine?
Who can blame a young boy for wanting to hold you
because you look so fine

Let me tell you once more
You&#39;re the one I adore
You&#39;re my C64!

I turn you on whenever I can
&#39;Cause you know how to keep me satisfied
You are the one who made me a man
Hey let&#39;s go, let me play with you tonight</info>
