 <info>Website description:

&#34;This was done for my friend Ian (zsazs) a couple months ago for his wedding. I tend to do wedding chiptunes a lot, because nothing can possibly be happier than an upbeat chiptune! If you canâ€™t smile while listening to chiptunes you have a cold, black heart and are probably a terrorist.&#34;

Secret hidden message:

&#34;cool as a cucumber
you laugh at my jokes and
when i post a song you
go and listen to it
you are snarky and cute
marry me ian!!
oh shoot gabi beat me to
it, and in 12 hours you
will be tying the knot!
oh my god :O
i hope you two stay happy
and healthy for like
1000 years
love love loooooooove&#34;
