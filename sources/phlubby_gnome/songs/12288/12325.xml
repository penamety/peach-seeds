Lyrics:
(breathing)

You may tell me you knew it (x3)
Was when I was around

You may tell me you knew it (x3)
Was when I was around

--

You always let me down
You always made me feel this way
And I don&#39;t think that you
Can understand my words today

Yeaaah yeahhh

Always let me (x3)
Always let me down

In a touch creating (x3)
Love like the light

In a touch creating (x3)
Love like the light

--

repeat
