 <info>From the musicdisk &#34;Closeup&#34;...

============
I think that &#34;Closeup&#34; contain some really good songs, and i hope u&#39;ll enjoy
it. when i started orginizing tha musicdisk, i thought it&#39;d be better to
cover more than a couple styles of music. as u can see, it has Jungle, Dream
Mellow, Ambient, and somethin like Fusion/Jazz (Radix+Tito&#39;s).
welp, enjoy it. :)
