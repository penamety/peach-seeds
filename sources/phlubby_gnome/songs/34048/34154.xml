 <info>More info about Ott and Bluemoon (http://www.bluemoon.ee)

Ott was the only musician in the Bluemoon team.

Bluemoon was a small team from Estonia who produced SoundClub, a sequencer for DOS and later Windows. SoundClub introduced me to trackers and sequencers.

Popcorn was a hit tune remixed and used for the tutorial-introduction to the DOS version of the program (1993).

SoundClub was released free in the early 2000. For interested people, it can be downloaded here: http://www.bluemoon.ee/history/scwin/index.html

Skyroads was a game produced by Bluemoon and the tunes (which you can find here on necta) were also written by Ott.

Bluemoon also brought the amazing peer-to-peer (P2P) technology and it is such a shame that the world knows so little about them. That&#39;s why I am writing this.
