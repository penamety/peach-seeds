 <info>Last night before the compo deadline I decided to enter. Having never used Renoise before, I downloaded the demo version and made this &#34;song&#34;, which was indeed a remix of Lost Patrol :)
Sorry for quality loss. This is because I had didn&#39;t have full version of Renoise to save wav file out to for mp3 encoding. 
Samples used are all stock Renoise samples.
Need to re-encode and improve this song overall :)
