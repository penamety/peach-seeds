 <info>This is finally a non-80s dance track of mine. I took the liberty of using plenty modern synthesizers and effects.

Practically the whole melodic composition was done on a single day, with another day or two of polishing and fine-tuning.

I spiced the mix a bit with a selection of fine female moans and sighs for added pleasure; hence the title 

I&#39;ve had just too much fun doing this.
