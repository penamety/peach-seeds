<br />Additional Information:<br /><i><p>my handle is the ytcracker</p>

<p>the progenitor of all the nerd rap that youre hearing today</p>

<p>there was a time in my life when the ladies didnt dig me</p>

<p>i didn&#39;t get laid and i didn&#39;t have a big screen</p>

<p>now they line up to see me asking for a freebie</p>

<p>cool down be less needy</p>

<p>were a little greedy - back in the day when no one cared</p>

<p>sitting in our basements face it</p>

<p>hacking on computers disassembling stuff</p>

<p>paid off in the end now who got it rough</p>

<p>the beauty of the baud and the world of the switch</p>

<p>make a new generation of us geekstas rich</p>

<p>we owned those that made fun of us tried to make a run at us</p>

<p>beat us up in class said yea theres a ton of us</p>

<p>who&#39;s laughing now &#39;cuz most of us your bosses</p>

<p>the rest of you are flipping burgers smelling secret sauces</p>

<p>this is the life of a meganerd baby</p>

<p>we doing things and we making it happen right</p>

<p>from the trash 80 to a black mercedes</p>

<p>no one can stop us now &#39;cuz we keeping nerdy nice</p>

<p>this is the life of a meganerd baby</p>

<p>we doing things and we making it happen right</p>

<p>from the trash 80 to a black mercedes</p>

<p>no one can stop us now &#39;cuz we keeping nerdy nice</p>

<p>i hated gym - &#39;cuz i never was athletic</p>

<p>i played a couple sports just to keep it copasetic</p>

<p>but i found more in computers than i ever could in hooping</p>

<p>every time i wrote a goto bitch i had that baby looping</p>

<p>basically basic was the first language i spoke</p>

<p>and i was telling apple deuces just where they could peek and poke</p>

<p>i had a five and quarter floppy labeled please dont drop me</p>

<p>used to load a million copies and no one could ever stop me</p>

<p>lived in the computer lab no one could separate us</p>

<p>and i never did my homework its no wonder others hate us</p>

<p>id get As on all my tests so nobody could debate us</p>

<p>now i&#39;m shouting from the mountain stc we are the greatest</p>

<p>never get discouraged just let your nerdy flourish</p>

<p>&#39;cuz were native to this code and the rest are all just tourists</p>

<p>if it ain&#39;t apparent now then just wait a couple years</p>

<p>when your gas is getting pumped by every one of those queers</p>

<p>this is the life of a meganerd baby</p>

<p>we doing things and we making it happen right</p>

<p>from the trash 80 to a black mercedes</p>

<p>no one can stop us now &#39;cuz we keeping nerdy nice</p>

<p>this is the life of a meganerd baby</p>

<p>we doing things and we making it happen right</p>

<p>from the trash 80 to a black mercedes</p>

<p>no one can stop us now &#39;cuz we keeping nerdy nice<br /></p></i>
