 <info>Sometimes I just want to be in a kitchen;
A small room, where there is nobody but food;
Time, and a chance to taste about every meal in my life.

But then, there would be strong will inside of me,
which fights but could not get out;
because everything would go out that way.
If I&#39;d want it or not.

But I can lead my stomach in the right direction,
when I make use of these forks and spoons,
and just eat...

There are many calories in every meat, in every pie, every beer.
We just need to recognize it and take our weight,
which leads to fascination.

How could we easily get back our shape!
With all these Bullshit-fat-reduced and diet- sodas?
They are poison!
They want to tell us we shouldn&#39;t keep our extra pounds,
and how slim we should stay.

Keep away this bullshit and gain some weight,
even if you don&#39;t know which dessert you will choose,
just eat...
And you will find, what you were searching for.
It is in fact not at all what you wanted, but
it will lead you onto the fat way.

Food -
eat, just eat</info>
