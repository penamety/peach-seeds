i need that green

that hocus pocus focus juice

don&#39;t need no fo&#39; or a deuce

just need that surge to help me get loose

i need that surge

that hocus pocus focus juice

don&#39;t need no fo&#39; or a deuce

just need that green to help me get loose



i said it&#39;s 2 in the am

and i&#39;ve been grinding on dreamweaver all through the day yea

i remember way back in &#39;99

when i could code all night (code all night)

down south they be dranking that purple sprite

but my lean is green and we call it surge

can&#39;t even put that in to words

my potion caffiene ocean



there was no bawls and there was no bull

just dew and jolt to keep your tank full

then a citrus blast hit - fantastic

had me jittering like an ultra spastic

now i need to get my fix with a mix

of the vk and the red

but surge alone was all i needed

for me to hack things

mack things carry back things



i need that green

that hocus pocus focus juice

don&#39;t need no fo&#39; or a deuce

just need that surge to help me get loose

i need that surge

that hocus pocus focus juice

don&#39;t need no fo&#39; or a deuce

just need that green to help me get loose



surge was the key to my success

&#39;cuz i never used to rest used to blast invest

my time in coding sleep eroding loading lists

with a two liter in my fist

i&#39;m pissed

i need to be reunited

with my elixir i cannot fight it

that long lost love and i cannot hide it (surge)



drinks these days don&#39;t have that punch

now i gotta drink 7up for lunch

what&#39;s up with that?  need energy

like megaman i&#39;m mega tee&#39;d

without my surge i&#39;m lost to sleep

i&#39;m just another tired isajeep

so bring it back let&#39;s save the surge

1-800-GET-COKE for all the nerds



i need that green

that hocus pocus focus juice

don&#39;t need no fo&#39; or a deuce

just need that surge to help me get loose

i need that surge

that hocus pocus focus juice

don&#39;t need no fo&#39; or a deuce

just need that green to help me get loose</info>
