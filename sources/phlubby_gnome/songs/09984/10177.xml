included defined

my masses of classes

headers i compiled and distribute

open source if youd like to contribute

arrays on arrays my stack grows a tribute

to pushing and popping

xor and nopping

systematic file locking

my sql knows no equal

indexed with my brain got a million people



eagerly waiting my macro advances

running with my beta &#39;cuz i&#39;m taking chances

increment i do while others keystyle

flavor to the n&#39;th goes to the n&#39;th mile

main function harness execution flow

arguments pass on and my programs slow

pass sleep to the infinite

my function so intimate

i know my code better than you

my code is mental

to the exponential

cyborg the quintessential

jacked in the matrix since day one

i see all the code and i watch it run

i see all the code and i watch it run



see all the code and i watch it run

see all the code and i watch it run

see all the code and i watch it run

see all the code and i watch it run



my fondness for subroutines

the code of machines

lies within my register set

i x&#39;ed every 86

86&#39;ed every x

buffer overflow in every respect

now

like a horse i&#39;m chomping at the bit

but 8 times that then i make it a hit

&#39;cuz my bytes a lot worse than my bark

and i&#39;m saving more screens than after dark



zero to one then one to zero

the nerd rap platinum superhero

since sweet sixteen the hexidecimal

being the king is somewhat stressful

with every gig i secure a gig

catch me on tour in a black toaureg

rolling with wifi on your block

prospering like dr spock
