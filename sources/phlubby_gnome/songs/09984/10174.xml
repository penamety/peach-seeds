-----------
buried on my hard drive are isos and isos

they call me the warez maestro wherever i go

up you a torrent and ill serve it off my dedi

ill trade you some porn if your upstream is steady

my irc bots serve movies and games

and razor cracks cut deep straight through your veins

you slang dvd rips? just ask me

you got that new star wars? yea its nasty



i am the warez loder

your free hookup on whatever you need

right to your high speed

dcc me

leech me

hit me on my aim you know how to reach me



keep your ratios up or i ban you off my tracker

if you ain&#39;t sharing you&#39;re prolly a hacker

my switch lights up like a christmas tree

when i&#39;m online surfing p2p

drop me a line when you see my handle

up in the names list in your channel

on second thought don&#39;t &#39;cuz its prolly a poser

the godfather ghost call me keyser soze



i am the warez loder

your free hookup on whatever you need

right to your high speed

dcc me

leech me

hit me on my aim you know how to reach me



i get all the good stuff before it hits the stores

i sweat zero day right out my pores

i get albums before they&#39;re finished rapping

terrabytes of porn so i&#39;m always fapping

every episode of every show

screeners of movies from tokyo

why pay for things if you get them free

even i serve my album on IRC



i am the warez loder

your free hookup on whatever you need

right to your high speed

dcc me

leech me

hit me on my aim you know how to reach me</info>
