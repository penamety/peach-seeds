-----------------------------
silent john incremental

another silent instrumental

the nerd rap existential

people compare me to mc chris or frontalot

but the fact is i predate them with significance (yeaaa)

i&#39;m the oldest geek rapper by far save k&amp;r

compiling kernels open bracket causing racket

MIT nerds throw your laser pen in the air

and wave it all around like it had no

repercussions

now follow instructions professor whiteys discussions

consist of nothing but incoherent rambling and babbling

but you should still take notes &#39;cuz you never know whats happening

ill drop a little nugget a tidbit if you will

there were four united states presidents named bill

if you run out of hit points the game will shout
&#34;YOUR LIFE FORCE IS RUNNING OUT&#34;



if you dig this

then you dug this

cause i&#39;m all about nerd life word life x4



let me start again

put it on like a cardigan

swing it like my name was mad martigan

which reminds me

warwick davis was willow and an ewok

leonard nimoy was galvatron and spock

if that ain&#39;t typecast i dunno what is

talk about predestiny nobody gets the best of me

i&#39;ve only played one role my whole lifetime

the nerd lifeline

streamed through a wigger pipeline

so no one can bite mine

&#39;cuz mine is original and i write rhymes

to burn on a cd play in your miniv

soccer moms yodel back yodel at the little me

i got a sidekick i gotta stay connected

watch out for my dcom or you&#39;ll get infected

and you don&#39;t wanna be one of my bots

cause i see it all like sauron the cyclops

and i wont hesitate to drop your whole netblock

if you&#39;re acting up and you&#39;re dumber than a pet rock

i&#39;m about this nerd life as you can see

spreading like a virus on mp3</info>
