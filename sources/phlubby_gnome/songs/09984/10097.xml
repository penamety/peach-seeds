Lyrics:
In the city where the walls came down.
The faces of the people stared right down,
on the ground.

The soldier&#39;s standing at the gates.
The moral outrage of the illiterate,
whining sounds.

The old man with his teeth kicked out.
His tongue is licking dust from the riverbed.
Sun and draught.

The daughter with her best dress on.
The father with his greedy eyes at his son,
wanting more.

The wise and the weak in mind
often you find
in the same place
water from drains
oh, in the same chains.

That man there has the need to fly
He&#39;s building wings that would take him to the sky,
far from town.

The tiles crumble under feet.
The blinded morning in the arms of the heat,
what went down?

The wise and the weak in mind
often you find
in the same place
water from drains
oh, in the same chains.</info>
