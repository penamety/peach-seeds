up up down down left right left right

then b a start the screen goes white

it&#39;s the cracker - ytcracker the game genie

8 bits with the 8 inch weenie

i don&#39;t break bricks i&#39;m not mario

but i&#39;m still old school like atari yo

i&#39;m the highly freestyly dr wily

beat me three times then you win a smiley



underground like the sewer where i kick it with raph

yodel back ninja turtles cowabunga where you at

jump on the cannon - the bricks where i&#39;m landin

gotta get the triforce gotta beat gannon

they called him the wizard in california

power glove on my wrist just had to warn ya

pitter patter on the power pad track and field

or be like ryus dad and get your chest peeled

in between neighboorhood laser taggin

wed all get together for some double dragon

helicopter kick bobo off the roof

have all his henchmen like &#34;what the hoof?&#34;

then wed butt heads with battletoads

double tapping right to run at foes

sometimes i&#39;d hit &#39;em with the double fist

then pop those rats just like a cyst



it kinda sucks now &#39;cuz my nes blinks red

i blow and blow but all my games are dead

thank god for roms and nesticle

played at every geek rap festival

this is the nerdrap entertainment system

and i hope you like the rhyme i spit

&#39;cuz the ytcracker stay nerd forever

if you wanna repeat just hit reset
