 <info>my handle is the ytcracker

the progenitor of all the nerd rap that youre hearing today

there was a time in my life when the ladies didnt dig me

i didn&#39;t get laid and i didn&#39;t have a big screen

now they line up to see me asking for a freebie

cool down be less needy

were a little greedy - back in the day when no one cared

sitting in our basements face it



hacking on computers disassembling stuff

paid off in the end now who got it rough

the beauty of the baud and the world of the switch

make a new generation of us geekstas rich

we owned those that made fun of us tried to make a run at us

beat us up in class said yea theres a ton of us

who&#39;s laughing now &#39;cuz most of us your bosses

the rest of you are flipping burgers smelling secret sauces



this is the life of a meganerd baby

we doing things and we making it happen right

from the trash 80 to a black mercedes

no one can stop us now &#39;cuz we keeping nerdy nice

this is the life of a meganerd baby

we doing things and we making it happen right

from the trash 80 to a black mercedes

no one can stop us now &#39;cuz we keeping nerdy nice



i hated gym - &#39;cuz i never was athletic

i played a couple sports just to keep it copasetic

but i found more in computers than i ever could in hooping

every time i wrote a goto bitch i had that baby looping

basically basic was the first language i spoke

and i was telling apple deuces just where they could peek and poke

i had a five and quarter floppy labeled please dont drop me

used to load a million copies and no one could ever stop me



lived in the computer lab no one could separate us

and i never did my homework its no wonder others hate us

id get As on all my tests so nobody could debate us

now i&#39;m shouting from the mountain stc we are the greatest

never get discouraged just let your nerdy flourish

&#39;cuz were native to this code and the rest are all just tourists

if it ain&#39;t apparent now then just wait a couple years

when your gas is getting pumped by every one of those queers



this is the life of a meganerd baby

we doing things and we making it happen right

from the trash 80 to a black mercedes

no one can stop us now &#39;cuz we keeping nerdy nice
