 <info>Not entirely sure what to classify this piece as. Perhaps trip hop, perhaps experimental, perhaps bitpop, perhaps bent and demented.

Based around a bit of a breakbeat, slowed down and whacked out... some hand drums... some bent keyboard sounds... some space cadet vocal phrases about mould growing in the salsa... misused techno sounds... a mid-section break to chiptune then back the bent theme... with an outro that&#39;s like a little musicbox gone wrong.

One of the best pieces I&#39;ve ever written, and certainly among the more strange ones.

Released a single track in 2001 for the group Inflicted.
