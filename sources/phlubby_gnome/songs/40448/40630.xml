 <info>Written in MultiTracker, as an accompaniment to some new Stunts tracks I made with a blank terrain I also made.

It&#39;s a bit demostyle, a bit dicky, making use of some of the cheesiest samples I could possibly find. Surprisingly well structured for what I intended to just be a bit of a joke. With some breakup sections from the main theme, but not what I would call middle-8&#39;s or choruses, or even Part A and Part B.

One of the better non-chiptune bitpop tunes I&#39;ve written.
