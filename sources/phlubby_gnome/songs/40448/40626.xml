 <info>A remix of one of my many in a series of &#34;Tacho&#34;. Something I started when I first began tracking. This one was the first dramatic change from the origins. The bassline changes to less driving and more a part of a rhythm combination with the dual tracked drums. The piano and chipchords fill out the melody quite well. I released several more versions or remixes of Tacho after this as well, all quite different again. Only two minutes long before it loops. 8 channel MOD.

Released originally in April 1997.
