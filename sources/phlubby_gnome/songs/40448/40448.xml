 <info>BEAM is a group of talented musicians with different styles and different 
backgrounds. The thing we all have in common is the will and courage to 
experiment with a handful of notes fetched from within our minds, and a 
compilation of rhythms rendered from our inner heartbeat. 

Each musician creates his/her own unique sound which we hope you will learn
to enjoy. In addition to experimental tracks we also carry musicians that 
occasionally release more commercial tracks which do not require a serious
listener. 

Within our selection of tracks I&#39;m sure you will find a track that suit 
your own style.</info>
