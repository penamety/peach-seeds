 <info>When I did this song, I put a lot of work in it. And worked with it
  until I began to like the song in a &#34;musical&#34; way, just not the same
  way I like songs like &#34;icefront.s3m&#34; etc. I asked a few experienced
  musicians, and they liked it. Okey, enough... I went to the fudge&#39;96,
  and intended to compete with this song. I also zipped a decent player
  with the song. And told the compo-manager, that THIS song was
  Impulse Tracker only. &#34;No problem&#34;, Maxwel. &#34;I know I know&#34;, Moony.
  AND finally the multichannel compo starts.. I notice that they use FT2
  to play the songs. taptaptap... nice songs ... People begun to vote ...
  Suddenly, &#34;You&#39;ve now heard ALL the multichannel modules!&#34;. What?
  People finnish off their voteforms. &#34;Now, the 4chn&#34;... Argh.
  I ask moony why my song weren&#39;t played. &#34;Wait a minute, there&#39;s
  an extra multichannel, uhm nr.. 18. Okey, AFTER this song; the 4 chn!&#34;.
  People seems to like the song.. Some of those who vote damn seriously
  place it 2nd. Few people attend to the song.

  Okey, I won&#39;t blame anyone. But this just irritates me.
