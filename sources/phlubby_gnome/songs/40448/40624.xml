 <info>Track 10 in the Hysterical Chipdisk. The most developed piece in the musicdisk, but still short, clocking in at just over a minute. Taking full advantage of some cheap and cheerful Casio drumsounds. Major scale intro &amp; outro with the main parts of the song utilising a repetitive minor scale riff.

Released originally in March 1997.
