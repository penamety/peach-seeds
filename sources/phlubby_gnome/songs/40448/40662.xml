 <info>9th in the Tacho remix series, this one features a crunchy Marshall distorted guitar playing the riff at 141bpm, with some stereo bass sounds at a couple of octaves, this is by far the best in the series. Chipleads are slightly reminiscent of the Funky Tacho chipchords in some places.

Using samples of a friend&#39;s Pearl Master Series drum kit for the rhythm, it could probably be bassier and more thumping, but I think the song holds its own pretty well as-is. Reminds me a little bit of Def FX.
