 <info>Short and sweet, one of my most quirky numbers. It&#39;s not quite chiptune although it has arpeggios, it&#39;s definitely not rock although it has drums &amp; bass guitar, and it&#39;s not quite experimental though it uses glass as a percussion instrument. It&#39;s in 7/4 time and 7/121 tempo, with plastic crackling as an intro.

One of my favourite songs that I&#39;ve written, and one of the strangest.
