 <info>A driving bass riff that carries the main theme throughout, this pop/funk ditty was another step up in quality for me. It was meant to be for a CD that Optix was going to put out, but as far as I know, never eventuated.

This was the first time I&#39;d successfully written an entire song with quality sounds and good riffs/melodies that lasted more than two minutes, and also my first time of using 16 channels.

I&#39;d been listening to a lot of Necros, Basehead, Legend, Liam The Lemming and other less chippy artists at this point, so tried to do something like their styles. I think it actually was somewhat of a success, being still enjoyable to listen to now, 17 years later. Though, of course, I&#39;m sure there is room for improvement.

Definitely one of the highlights of my early years, probably the best of all of them actually.
