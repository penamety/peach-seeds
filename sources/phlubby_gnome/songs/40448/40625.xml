 <info>Track 11 in the Hysterical Chipdisk. The song with the most driving riff, the most foot-tapping of the Hysterical collection, based around a line that would be at home in a hard rock song. Deliberate hard panning of bass left and drums right, with the arpeggio and melody gluing it together in the middle.

Released originally in March 1997.
