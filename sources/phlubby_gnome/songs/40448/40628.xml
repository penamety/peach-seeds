 <info>Dance tune based on slowed down breakbeat ripped from a Chuck Biscuits track. Beefed up the breakbeat, inserted some punchy bass guitar and high pitched plinky piano, turned it into a I-IV-V catchy repetitive number that goes for two and a half minutes with a bit of variation around the insistent theme. Moderate-quick tempo. Doubles the timing after the intro.</info>
