 <info>(c) basehead / fm 1996

inspired by the music of yennek, 3mb, eddie fowlkes and juan atkins. a tribute to the detroit sound....

samples from: roland jv800, the orb, maelcum, chuck biscuits, stalker, jogeir liljedahl, c.c.catch, dizzy, vinnie, octoque

n-joi

(btw-- as far as i know, this tune only sounds correct in Impulse Tracker version 2.02, so if you play it with some other player, i don&#39;t guarantee it&#39;s correct.)
