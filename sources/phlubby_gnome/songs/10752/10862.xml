 <info>Long song is long. The extreme duration of this song was not intentional, but hence it was one of the first ones I made, it got this disadvantage. I plan on remixing this one into something more &#34;compact&#34;. Until then, this is the full one.

Banned for the following reasons: song too long for what it is, song got low votes, song got complaining in the oneliner, song got complaints in the comments, and the artist suggests it&#39;s a learning tune.  We suggest considering a hypothetical compact version enabled if and when it&#39;s uploaded instead of this one. --- sqrmax</info>
