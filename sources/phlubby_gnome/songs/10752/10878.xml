in 1995

to my amazing girlfriend: sai, with much much love... of all things, you have been best in my entire life.
thank you...
for you... this title has special meaning - others can draw their own conclusions. long hours i&#39;ve spent with you - each one worth those memories that will last for a lifetime... even through all the changes in my ife and all the grief i&#39;ve been through - there has been a constant... you, and without you there... i may not even be alive today, and this song could never have been written.
i am eternally grateful to you, and will remain that way forever, nothing can destroy my feelings for you - and nothing can erase the hapiness that just a smile or touch from you brings me.
for all you listeners out there who really don&#39;t care much about this sample text - remember one thing: nothing is more precious, and no gift is greater than the love of a lifetime...

peace,
May 17th, 1995.
