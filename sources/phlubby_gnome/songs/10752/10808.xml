The name really says it all with this song. It&#39;s just a vehicle for a solo. Before, i was really dissed about this tune,  but the final result is not too bad, as it turns out.
Quick greets go to: necros, mellow-d, cybelius, maelcum, obaid/diablo, ryan cramer (thanks for the fantastic pad samples you did for us!), nemesis, black artist, and all the people i forgot, as i can not honestly remember any one&#39;s name today :). A special greet goes out to all those who appreciate blues/rock guitar music, of the real, humbucked but not overclipped, sound.
