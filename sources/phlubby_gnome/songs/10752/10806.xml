 <info>Relation Theory
a co-op tune between Chuck Biscuits and Ozone

Originally finished in september 1995 for a Heretics intro called &#34;Two&#34; and released in october 1996 under the Kosmic Free Music Foundation.
Tested fine in IT, CapaMod and Mod4Win. DO NOT PLAY in Cubic!: the volume slides are completely incorrect.
