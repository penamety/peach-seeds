 <info>This one originated just like an experiment with the Bloody Machine song. I wanted the chorus high
tones to last longer, so I was playing with looping the sample. After some coincidental
shortening of the forward loop lenght, it sounded normally and then looped like a chiptune,
which I quite liked. In this track are also the ideas that didn&#39;t make it to the first song, namely the shouting vocal thing and reversed drum beat.</info>
