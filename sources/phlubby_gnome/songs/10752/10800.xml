Another stream of conscious and semi-conscious babbling from my exam-fragmented brain.

This song is dedicated to all those who have helped me get through - your help means alot more than i can express my gratitude for in words, so here instead is my gesture.

This track is actually two sections, which are: ord 00-089: bubbling brew, ord 89-141: empire

Greets: cosmic(rr), andrewm, tecel, (G)eorge
