.. this is my tribute to art of noise; who are, in my opinion, one of the greatest, and most underrated groups ever...
this style is totally a tribute to them... they invented it... and all you a.o.n. fans out there, will recognize the style...
the intro is almost an exact copy of &#34;opus 4&#34; from &#39;in visible silence&#34;...
anyway, thanks to audiomonster, eon, and a.o.n. themselves for some of these cool samples.
anyway, this is not meant to be a totally serious song or release... but i hope you like it anyway.
