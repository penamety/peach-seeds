 <info>Sad man&#39;s groove
Composed and tracked by Chuck Biscuits / Heretics

finished on 24th sept &#39;94

Sorry about the size of the huge bloody samples, even though the quality is pretty shitty.

This tune is dedicated to my friend roselle, for being the coolest person to write acid, funk and blues with.

Gear used in this track; 72 Fender Strat (using bridge pickup), Ibanez TubeScreamer overdrive pedal, ROland TR-727&amp;909 kits, Yamaha TG-55 kit, my homemade preamplifier.

About 90% of the samples are original - a pleasant change for me, huh ? &lt;g&gt;

The TR-727 is only used for the Jawbola sound, but hey, that sound is just so damn cool I felt obliged to use it... :-)
