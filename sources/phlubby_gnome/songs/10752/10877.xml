Ok, i hope you like this module... it was composed in about 4 or 5 hours on 7 october 1994... samples from timelord, necros, krystall, alpha, and a few cd&#39;s... wave for windoze was used for some sample editing, and the tune was composed in st3 by psi/fc.

it runs about 7:16, or so, so sit back with a nice sound system, and let it relax you.

greetings go out to: majesty, necros, maelcum, khyron, ryan cramer, and all other irc frequenters.

see ya in my next production.................................peaceout!
