Actually the title should
be&#34;Jonne&#39;s new motorbike&#34;
, but this sounds more
motorbike style :)
 
This song is wasted time,
because Pm&#39;s version
1ooo X beter, but it is
just such a cool song...
 
There are 2 ways to
contact me:
 
Race over the digital
highway and send
something to:

or take your new
motorbike and race to:
 
Koolweg 7o
6181 Bn
Elsloo (the famous
        motorbike city)
Holland
 
Wondering why I called
this song Johnny&#39;s
new motorbike? Well, It
sounds a little like
&#34;Big Honda 10cc&#34;...
