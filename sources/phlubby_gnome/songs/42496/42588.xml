This was my BMP compo II entry this year. What a huge compo! 500+ entries. Man and I thought the MC&#39;s where big. No wonder the results are taking so long to get back. As of this point I still don&#39;t know what place(s) I got (I entered 2 songs as per the rules). But it&#39;s the competition that counts in the end not the ranking. I&#39;m pretty new to the techno/electronica genre and am still learning what song is what style etc. and how I should make the songs sound. But hey, you gotta give me credit for entering :)

I really don&#39;t know where most of the samples came from. The ones I do I put the credits in the sample text.</info>
