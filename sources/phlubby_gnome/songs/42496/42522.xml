 <info>Music from the invitro to PixelShow 2007 Greek demoparty.

&#34;PixelShow will take place between 11 and 13 of May, 2007 at the theater of Patra&#39;s University campus.It&#39;s the same place as for the last PixelShow 2005 and exactly in the same spot where ReAct and Gardening 96/97 took place in the past.

We have decided to make a major change to the demo compo.
For PixelShow 2007 we will hold a Combined Demo Compo, hopefully, featuring demos on a vast variety of platforms.&#34;</info>
