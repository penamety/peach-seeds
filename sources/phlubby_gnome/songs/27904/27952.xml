 <info>Massive spanx to Makke for the epic lyrics
you rock
Totally forgot to upload to RKO.
So here you go. Better late than never. :)

The knight looked up and over the fields,
Red with the blood and guts of his sworn enemy.
Once again the good had prevailed and evil been forced back to the flaming pits of the underworld from whence it came.
When he turned around, he realised he was the only man still standing.
All his allies had fallen, died by the sword to defend the right,
And, as he walked away towards the horizon, he was truly the last hero.
