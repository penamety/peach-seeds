 <info>Note from skaven&#39;s site:
&#34;The musical suite composed for Bejeweled 2, a sequel to the popular PopCap game. The music is also a sequel to the original Network (which you can find below). 31 minutes of 80&#39;s style synth-ambient music. Contains multiple parts.&#34;

Note from admin: (the uploader omitted this info on purpose): &#34;Note: the track is long, so the MP3 / OGG downloads are huge. Copyright PopCap Games. Do not use in other productions.&#34;

[i]Note: Play time has been cut to 12 minutes.[/i]</info>
