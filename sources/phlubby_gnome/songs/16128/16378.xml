 <info>Prepare your ears for an experiment you won’t forget ! For sure Sweet Smoke (SPACE9.XM) was at that time my favorite track of my friend Pierrick Hansen and i would like to remix it since few weeks… During those end of january 98 i should be come back early in Seraing and then i had finally some times to work on this project, after 3 hours of work, sampling new sounds from Thunderdome XI : The Director, Lanchinhouse, Comotion and also from my Roland E68.

Anyway Sweet Smoke will not included in the next Cyborg Jeff’s album. Later i will not so enthousiast by quality result and that’s why i rework on it few years later. But Pierrick like this new version. I found a SPACE9_2.XM finished in april 1998 inspirated from my remix but with more Piek&amp;Fast Tracker touch as i can’t use easely the .IT format.</info>
