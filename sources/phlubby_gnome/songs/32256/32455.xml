By Aymes.fromage

For the Outpost KO compo 2 (round 1)!!! www.outpostmusic.com

I hope i get through, but at least it forced me to track once more :D

This disturblingly titled tune is, imo, a terribly frightening mixture of
way too much Gunbound and Final Fantasy playing mixed in with my own insanity.
I hope you like :D

This was written with the amazing &#34;Cheese Tracker&#34; by Reduz, for anyone who
prefered to write music in Impulse Tracker but dont like Mpt in Windows I
cant recommend it enough!!

So on that note, HUGE greets to the man Reduz! Also for his pointers on volumes
for this.
Also big greets to Slashman, Elky, Aulin, Gopher, Metasonix and all you others
who actually talk to me!!
Greets to the outpost krew for organising this compo, its coolies

Someone needs to organise a tracking party godamnit.
