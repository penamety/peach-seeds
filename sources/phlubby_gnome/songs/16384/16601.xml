 <info>Wouw, a long time ago i hoped realising a CD Album and no more audio-tape compilations. The project would be possible since my neightboors and friend Vivien Vanoirbeek received is brand new computer with a CD-Rom Burner SCSI.

This first album : Divagation, need me a lot of work, first as i should render the selectionned track to Stereo WAV files, i should add stereo aspect to all that modules, that why you could find a line : STEREO VERSION MIX. Then i should remove my Windows 3.11 and Formula One GP2 to have enough place on my Hard Drive and brought it many times to transfer the datas. My 200mo IDE one could not be used in the SCSI architecture. Anyway my friend have a 650mo hard drive, that means i should forget some tracks and burns a smaller album… on great gold CD-Rom… the first Cyborg Jeff’s album was born !

Few years later, listening to the mixed compilation Club System 3 i recognised a song with a similar melody than this one, Ayla – Ayla… I was probably influenced by that when i wrote this one !
