 <info>Well, here is the last songs of the year 1996, a loop track for the menu of the first game realised by PPP Team Software under Game Maker… in 1995. Pengo’s Adventure was not a great game, juste our first realisation with that tool, using the original pingouin of the software. Maybe did you recognize our Bilou as the first boss.. in a Donkey Kong like level !</info>
