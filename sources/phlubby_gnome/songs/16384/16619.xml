 <info>Yes, it’s the summer holiday… after a song called : « Summer Snow » and another one « Go to Holiday », here is « Summer Flight ».. A song that i realy like mixing intersting piano melody on a Dance arrangement with some kwel organ sounds and a « Ayééé » from Confetti’s.

You should know i work a lot on this track cause i would like to astonnished Didier Rombauts the Wivine’s brother that i’ve just met at La Troupe de l’Îlot. As i’m was managing the sounds there, Wivine told me about his brother that have just finishing his Sound Studio and will now go to learn that at school… Wooaw, i imagined it was the chance of my life. A producer who will create my album ! I’ve all the chance cause it was the brother of someone i know !

Back at home, i began to work on a new song that let me proof my skills. Not a techno song, so i copied it on 2 floppies to be sure the data will not lost with that summer sun… Give it to him… no words… And i think he probably never be able to read the .S3M data files ;)

It was our first and hopefully, not the last met.

Later, in 2000, i’ll rework that track for the album HTML Quest and the Bilou’s project on GBA.</info>
