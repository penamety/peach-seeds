 <info>For all the one who loved my piano’s melody from the year 1996, i would like to write a new song, with some trance aspect but with a lot of magical feeling… Inspirated from the sound track of the game Innerworld and using some excellent piano’s samples from Romeo Knight, the result are dreaming. I had mentioned that i was a lot inspirated from the Romeo Knight song, Boesendorfer, but after hearing it now, the both songs was enough different.

Planer n’est pas jouer was a master piece of the K7 Tape album realised in 1997 before being re-edited in a CD format and on Jamendo in 2007. On the original cover, you could see Lara Croft flying up a Chess play.
