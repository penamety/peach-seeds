 <info>My friend Toon (Antoine Reeckmans) from the IAD was dreaming to sing, dance, rap and make music… So he was quickly close to our X-Perimental Association from LLN. Me, I realy like creating music for other people, it was each time a great experience. So Toon, would like to have something that sounds Groove and Rap for a Movie Clip project… It’s not the best thing i was able to do… the result was really dark… and with some clavecins.</info>
