 <info>Another brothers crazy project we had during our carnaval holidays at the Noord Zee. We had imagined a two players Pac Man game. So why using the Namco licence when we are P.P.P. Team Software and a lot of imagination ! Two heroes that eat PacGomme and Ghost…. Here is Slurp and Burp !

The concept is settle and back from my PC i’m starting to write the musics of this new project. Here is the first theme, victory and SupraPacGomme one. For sure written in S3M 6 tracks to fit the brother ASM player.</info>
