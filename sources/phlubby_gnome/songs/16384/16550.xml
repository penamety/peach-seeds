 <info>The most part of this song was realised during october 1997, during holidays in Seraing where i was preparing Virtual Music concert and found also time to see Delphine and Valentin. But iâ€™ve never found the good feeling. I tryed to be in the same mood than [song]1436[/song] without success. Vocals were added at the end of the year on the musical part worked around new samples from the Future Music Magasine. Finally not satisfacted, i had not included the track to Esperenza album.</info>
