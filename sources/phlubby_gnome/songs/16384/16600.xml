 <info>Boris inspiration began to be on my mind. I want to write Dream music as Robert Miles that i’ll mix with strange stories counting, as in Boris. The piano melody was inspirated from the song Jaleous Guy that i’ve just discovered on a very old tape of John Lennon in my father’s stuff.

This new song is the beginning of the brand new Cyborg Jeff Dream music period with electronic music and fresh melodies.

The instruments came from my Yamaha PSR 210 but also from friends samples of Pierrick &amp; Parmesan.

This song appears on the old tape i recorded in 96 and was on the new CD edition of the album « Planer n’est pas jouer ».
