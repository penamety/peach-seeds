 <info>open your eyes
look at the sky
clouds are floating
let the sun shine


---------------------------------------
downtown life, that&#39;s not easy
people die on corner streets
she must sell a part of her
if she wants to eat a piece of bread

there&#39;s no rule in downtown life
people from uptown prefer don&#39;t care
why god had left them
here she wants to fight for a piece of breath

She hope one day, she&#39;s the one
an uptown boy make her his wife
caus there women can&#39;t give us a child
all the nights she pray and she cry

fat grey clouds have stop to rain
there&#39;s a light perhaps the sunshine
people from downtown scream to this flight
This young boy show her, she&#39;s the one
