 <info>Here is a track mainly inspirated from the Techno song from Faithless and Sash!, worked around a 6 tracks arrangement for the Bilou’s Adventures… I was imagined the song for a fight between Bilou and a big boss in a dark bayou.. No idea about the boss morphology, for now, probably Toad have a chance, but at that time imagine something more speed as the battle of Rayman and Moskito… that explain the title of this song !</info>
