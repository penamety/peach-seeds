 <info>So, a long time i didn’t have write song like this… stop Dance and Trance music… i was back to the roots with an oldschool maybe chiptunes track that could be great as sound track for an amiga shoot’m up…
Such kind of song that i’m happy to have written…

So long time lost in a never released project here is a rock remix version realised by the french musician Xenon (Fabrice Tonnelier)
