 <info>1st April, i was that sunday in the Centre Culturel from Seraing for a new concert of the musical academy Léon Deleval where my brother, my sister and my mother will perform… I met there my friend JedD. Listening to the orchestra, i had the idea to mix techno trance song with a philharmonic orchestra… Back at home, i began to work on it !

Sure, it was not so easy to do such a song with a small 80386 computer and the Scream Tracker, anyway with some intersting samples i add trumpets, piano, violins, xylophone and flute to my techno sounds and jungle beat… the result is intresting !

I also had the time to watch to the Brazil Grand Prix winnen by Damon Hill on the Williams Renault.
