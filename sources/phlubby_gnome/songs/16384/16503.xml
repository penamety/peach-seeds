 <info>Just dream… the Crazy Brix project began to be kwel… We could play it, it’s still often crashed, but my brother Pype have succeed to add my soundtrack modules in the game… So i was imagined we could have an animated intro with a Dance Track in the mood of 2 Unlimited but including oldschool C64 sounds…. Something realy ambitious for Breakout like game.

Hit the bricks was born… counting once again the adventures of Jack Boost in a new kind of spaceship !

Ref :

You must burn,
You must run,
Hit the bricks, hit hit hit the bricks

Coup :

You have been chosen,
‘cause you are the best,
‘cause you could pass this mission

You have been chosen,
You must save the earth,
You must shoot this fiction

Pont :

No question, only the best weapons
You must hit the bricks or we gonna sick
Throw your ball and shoot them all
If you heard a tick, you have hitten a brick
