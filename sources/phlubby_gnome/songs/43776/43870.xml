&#34;Dream Crusher&#34;
[i]A poem by Nelson Addison[/i]
[i]Written 3.30.17[/i]
-------------------------------------------------
Crush my dreams, why don’t you?
They’ll never come true anyway.
Smell the coffee, awake to the clues:
Aspirations are a thing of yesterday.

Yesterday, when I was a boy.
You were a kid once too.
Don&#39;t trash my dreams like broken toys;
Kill mine cause yours aren&#39;t true.

Don’t throw me down into a pit,
Submerge my coat in blood.
Don’t sell my heart for fifty cents,
Then pull me from the mud.

I&#39;m destined to do great things someday.
You could&#39;ve been a part.
Instead you sent me on my way,
And hurt my fragile heart.

If dreams can die like people do,
Then I don&#39;t want to know.
I&#39;ll keep believing ‘til I&#39;m through.
Put misery below.

I&#39;ll keep on dreaming ‘til I die,
Until they are alive.
I&#39;ll keep on reaching for the sky,
And soon I will arrive.
----------------------------------------------

Basically, the song title and poem are about adults, people whose dreams often didn&#39;t come true. I feel sympathy for you guys, but don&#39;t crush my dreams; there&#39;s still time for mine to come true.

This is the &#34;theme&#34; for the sci-fi book I&#39;m writing at the moment.

Track done using Renoise 3.1.

Synths used: 
Superwave P8 (VST)

Literally the only VST instrument I used in this track. [i]Very[/i] good virtual analog synth.

VST FX used: 
Too many. All the FX required for a good mix  and master (compression, EQ, multiband compression, stereo expander) and some preamp simulator FX here and there to add a bit of warmth and analog saturation.</info>
