If you like this song,
then please favorite
it! This is my first
song under my new name
eXOdus. Thanks for
listening!

This song is dedicated
to all my friends, my
family, my loves, and
to everyone who
listened to this song.
But most of all, this
song is dedicated to
Elwood and Anvil, the
two Tracking Kings. I
wish they still
tracked. This remix
isn&#39;t as good as the
original, but I hope
that if you like the
original, that you
will like the remix. I
was hoping to finish
this song on my birth-
day (May 6, 14 yrs.),
but school prevented
this. I&#39;ll be a 9th
grader this fall! And
with physical growth
comes experience!

This is the first song
on my album Elwood
Rebirthed. I will have
more Elwood remixes
coming soon!
Coming Soon (maybe):
Dead Lock Remix
Into the Shadow Remix
Sick on Monday Remix

Song indicates that I
