 <info>Move! Bitbear&#39;s music entry for the demoscene party Solskogen 2015&#39;s Newschool Music Competition. 

The first sketch of the song was started many years ago and then placed in hibernation until the night of Thursday 8th of July, where I finally had some time to attempt doing a track for Solskogen&#39;s Newschool Music Competition. 

I brute forced myself through the night and produce an arrangement-wise complete song that I delivered at the party the 10th of July, but it was full of bugs so the mix sounded awful. Thus, I&#39;ve reworked large parts of it so it sounds like this. Hope you like it!</info>
