We are sitting here
and try to party
but we get depressed
by the music

The room is dark
and so are our souls
The bass is dark
and so is the room

But we hope it will change
change in a few minutes
to something better
to something more h0ffman
ohu ohu h0ffman

But it doesn&#39;t happen

We gonna be depressed
for the rest
of this song
we gonna be depressed
for the rest of this song
for the rest of this song

But it doesn&#39;t happen

This is the sound of a C64 (SID) 
Smashed on the floor (Crash)
by a young carnivore (Rooar)
and then cut by a chainsaw (Kettens√§ge)

I am sure you adore
this kind of metaphor
and you shall not ignore
that it&#39;s just a commodore
ho ho ho
happy easter everywhore
