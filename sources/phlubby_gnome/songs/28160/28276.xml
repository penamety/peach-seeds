 <info>This is part of a group of modules called from the author &#34;Area 05:  Hokuto No Ken&#34;.

&#34;This area is *!*  recommended  *!* to all those people KenShiro&#39;s fanatic. (Hokuto No Ken also called NorthStar)
These modules below are quite small because they were composed for a videogame. (never realized...)
Therefore some instruments could not have a great audio quality ...but this is balanced from the high quality of remixes!
