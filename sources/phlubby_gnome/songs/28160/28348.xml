 <info>- Who are you?
- My name is Pussy Galore.
- I must be dreaming.

Fast as lightning when on you he strikes,
Comes from the sky without warning.
Like a warhawk down he dives;
You&#39;ll be dead before the morning comes.

Licensed to kill
Women&#39;s his thrill
No need to fear
Mr Bond is here.

Like a warhawk down he dives.
Keeps his foe within his deadly (??? prize?)

In Her Majesty&#39;s Service he&#39;s bound.
Duty before all to you, he&#39;s found.

Licensed to kill
Women&#39;s his thrill
No need to fear
Mr Bond is here.

Fast as lightning when on you he strikes,
Comes from the sky without warning.
Like a warhawk down he dives;
You&#39;ll be dead before the morning comes.
