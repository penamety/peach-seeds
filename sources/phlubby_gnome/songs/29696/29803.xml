&#34;Miszter P likes Funky&#34;

Miszter P is a person I don&#39;t know.
Probably he dwells in a dark deep cave in Ulgyflerp.
Anyway he likes funky music, but some day he went
crazy so now he&#39;s got nothing else to do but hunt the
bats in his cave.
Sorta weird? Yeh, me thinks so too.

The problem with Miszta P is that he can&#39;t focus on
anything. Thoughts shoot through his brain in rapid
succession.

One night, Miszta P dreamed all the s had become sz&#39;s
and music was now used to paint city with many colours.
He was not on any drugs.

Neither am I.
