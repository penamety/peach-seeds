 <info>Lyrics:
Information in a computer is stored as thousands of zeroes and ones called bits. 2x

On a CD-ROM, bits are represented by microscopic holes and bumps called pits and lands.
When a laser beam is reflected off of these tiny hills and valleys into a photo diode, they turn into an electrical pulse that a computer recognizes as a stream of zeroes and ones, thus recreating words, images, and sounds. x2</info>
