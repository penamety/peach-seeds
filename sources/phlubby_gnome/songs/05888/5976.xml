 <info>Lyrics (by Kim Ault):
If I could gather all the stars and hold them in my hand,
the colors I would then possess would not be half as grand
as those which I have seen when I look deep into your eyes,
or come across when I have kissed your lips, I realize.

If I could ponder all the truths men sought since time began,
they would not teach me more than if I were to touch your hand
For truth to no one you have touched appears as simple lies
And nothing could be truer than your touch, I realize.

If I were given lasting life as only God could do,
I&#39;d shun it all and turn away, if I could live with you.
For even God has never known the immesurable size
Of the love that is within your heart, I realize.</info>
