 <info>Lyrics:
Choose no life.
Choose no career.
Choose no family.
Choose a f**king big computer.
Choose graphic cards, soundcards, hard disks, noisy as washing machines.
Choose staying up late.
Choose any kind of cola, salty peanuts and visiting your dentist very often.
Choose no friends.
Choose your competitors.
Choose sitting in front of your computer for the f**king whole day.
Choose glasses.
Choose what you&#39;re gonna say to your girlfriend when she asks you to get a real life.
Choose DIY and wondering why the f**k you are coding something senseless on a Sunday morning.
Choose sitting on a plastic chair watching mind-numbing, spirit-crushing demos, stuffing f**king junk food into your mouth.
Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing your last in a miserable zine, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, f**ked-up lamers gaming industry spawned to replace the computer artist.
Choose your future.
Choose scene.
