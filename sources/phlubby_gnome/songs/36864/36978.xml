Let me tell you a tale, the tale of the undone invitation. Demodays (as well as Buenzli) had an invitation every year - be it a demo, intro or even a game. This year, we didn&#39;t manage to bring a proper invitation to life. Nevertheless, we definitively want to set you into party mood right now: so here is an invitation tune ! See you all in a few days : )</info>
