Written by Novus
Released for Sound Devotion
16-bit version released on Thursday, September 30th, 1999.
8-bit version released on Sunday, March 19th, 2000.

For this 8-Bit Mix of &#34;Beacon,&#34; I mixed all of the 16-bit samples down to
8-bit and then cut out the whispered vocals and the sound effects. I&#39;m not
nearly as happy with this version of &#34;Beacon&#34; as I am with the
full-quality 16-bit version, but a lot of people were balking at
downloading a 2-meg file, and I realized I had to be practical.

I will say this, though... although very few people have downloaded the
16-bit version of &#34;Beacon,&#34; none of them have regretted it. So, if you
enjoyed this mix, you ain&#39;t heard nothing yet. Go to my web page and get
the 16-bit version. You won&#39;t be sorry.</info>
