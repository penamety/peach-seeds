&#34;Cracked Nostalgia&#34; (compo edition, one loop)
By gusse &amp; loonie ^ digisonix

Started in FT2 by Loonie 1999
Finished in MilkyTracker by Gusse 2013
4 Channels
17kb

There is a little story behind this one.

After finalizing a bunch of old tunes without any size/channel restraints I wanted to challenge myself. The goal was to make a little 4chn chip no more than 20kb. Possibly as a contribution for the EDISON 2013 oldschool/tracked music competition.

I scanned through my old workfiles and stumbled upon a few patterns from 1999 I could not remember having made. I got a bit of an inspiration going, came up with an idea for a progression and hammered it out as fast as I could. It ended up the tune you can listen to on this page.

…the thing was I still wasn’t sure about those instigating patterns so I asked around with some old scene friends. Finally it turned out those first patterns were made by Loonie. It was something he wrote down when he was brainstorming for a contribution for the chiptune compo at LTP3-party back in 1999.

I asked if he was OK with me releasing this tune as a coop, he said yes and here we are.

We hope someone enjoys the final tune!
