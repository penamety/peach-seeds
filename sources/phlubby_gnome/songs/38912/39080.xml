This is the demoscene pre release of my new track. There will be some minor changes after the party because they couldn&#39;t be implemented in time. Again this is not the &#34;regular&#34; demoscene sound, but something I would like to have you think about for more than just the moment it is played in the competition. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did creating it. Thanks again to my dear friend Ellina for her vocals.

They are awesome and make the track sound like I wanted it to do.
