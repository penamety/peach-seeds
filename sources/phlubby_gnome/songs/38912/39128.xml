 <info>The music used in the &#34;End of Wars&#34; part in the Offence demo called SCROLLWARS.

This tune was both my first  CheeseCutter tune and my first new release after 23 years.

(SID and PRG) will be released seperately within few days by me.

Signed 
Scarzix

btw. it loops around 04:20, so someone ought to &#34;crop&#34; it.</info>
