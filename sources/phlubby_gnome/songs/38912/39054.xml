Miss Polly is a dolly
She&#39;s sweeter than a lolly
But to kiss her would be folly
&#39;Cause you&#39;re buzzed right off your trolley
I wish ???
You&#39;re a sheep and she&#39;s your collie
You never will get out of there alive

And Sandy comes in handy (oh?)
When you&#39;re feeling slightly randy (aha!)
She looks as cute as candy
When you&#39;re halfway through the brandy
The problem is with Sandy (what?)
Although you might think it&#39;s dandy
Is she shares a bed with Mandy (ooh!)
And you never will get out of there alive

Woke up naked... that&#39;s gonna be expensive

And ??? is a fella
Best believe me when I tell ya
She&#39;s got secrets in the cellar
But if that turns your propeller
Then you get out there and tell her
Do your moves, yeah, Bella
But you never will get out of there alive
