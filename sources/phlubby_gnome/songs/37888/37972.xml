Lyrics:
When you arrive, you&#39;re greeted by the infoteam
Then you sit down and unpack all your stuff
You have a drink, and start working on your release
There is still time and you&#39;re making progress fast

This is Revision, the party you&#39;ve been waiting for
After a year, we&#39;re back and it is wonderful
Sit on a meadow, and talk to friends inside the hall
Have a great time, we&#39;re happy, that you&#39;re here

You take a break and chat with folks from everywhere
The sun is bright and atmosphere is- VERY LOUD AND MESSY INSIDE THE MAIN HALL -great
Evening comes, the hall is getting pretty full
Opening&#39;s over and a dj starts to- ANNOY YOU WITH TERRIBLY LOUD RAVE MUSIC -play

This is Revision, the party you&#39;ve been waiting for
After a year, we&#39;re back and it is wonderful
Sit on a meadow, and talk to friends inside the hall
Have a great time, we&#39;re happy, that you&#39;re here

The second day, you&#39;re tired but you feel- DEAD INSIDE -okay
Go get some- BOOZE -coffee, it&#39;ll help you right away
After a shower, life is looking great again APART FROM THE FACT THAT YOUR RELEASE IS NOT DONE YET
It&#39;s compo time soon: is your release done yet? IT IS NOT AND YOUR AMIGA BROKE

This is Revision, the party you&#39;ve been waiting for
After a year, we&#39;re back and it is- STILL ALL ABOUT USING TOTALLY OBSOLETE COMPUTERS -wonderful
Sit on a meadow, and talk to friends inside the hall
Have a great time, we&#39;re happy, that you&#39;re here

Share a beer, some stories at the fireplace
Everyone meets inside to see the show
The big screen is- SHOWING TOO MANY ADVERTISEMENTS -big - the soundsystem is- ALMOST AS BAD AS THE NETWORK CONNECTION -pretty great
So many entries COULD NOT BE FINISHED IN TIME and you want to see them all

AFTER SOME BEERS
YOU VISION STARTS TO FADE AWAY
YOU SEE FOUR PEOPLE
BUT THERE ARE ONLY TWO

YOU NEED TO PEE
BUT THE TUNNEL IS TOO LONG TO GO
HOPE NO ONE SEES WHERE
YOU DID NUMBER TWO
