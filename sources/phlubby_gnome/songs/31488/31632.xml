 <info>4th at Kindergarden 2010 Dance Music Compo

-----------------------------------------------------
I released a lo-fi + lo-fi (lo-fi) song at the Kindergarden dance music competition: STORM RAVE. It ended up as #4 in the compo. That seems fair.

It was made with mostly (only?) sounds from ST-01 and ST-02 (that means Amigaaaaa 1987), and encoded in 80kbps to hide the lamer sound of Renoise. Lol-yeah-ölollö!

Also performed live and was interviewed by one of the authors of MusicLine (best ‘chip’-tracker, except for LSDj and Defmon?). Find the recordings on “internet”.
