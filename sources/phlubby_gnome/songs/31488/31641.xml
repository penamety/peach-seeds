 <info>Once upon a time, in a land, there was a man.
He had a pony. They were best friends.
Until his [co-worker?] ???... secret of the pony.
He said:
My pink
My pink
My pink, my pink pony
My pink pony was a male...

???...
The man would never smile again.
It was obvious that his life was destroyed forever. (*Neigh!*)
My pink
My pink
My pink, my pink pony
My pink pony was a male...
