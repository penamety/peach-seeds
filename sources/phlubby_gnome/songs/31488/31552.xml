 <info>From a 11 second long loop i made a while back, me [Kanonat] and Gustav [LargerThanLink] sat down and thought real hard.
We spent one day making the song to about 1:19 long.
I said at this time, as i had to go home:
Some songs feel like they don&#39;t deserve to be worked more with, this one on the other hand... oh my god, we have to make it alteast twice as long!
So the day after i went to his house again and we composed the rest of this epic piece.
I am quite positive - this is the best song i&#39;ve ever worked with up to this date during my ~3 years of music making =)
Enjoy big time!
