&#34;Dimension 2012&#34; - The only song with a drum loop :) This is vaguely dance-ish style with a few interesting chords thrown in... I apologize if some of the samples aren&#39;t perfectly looped, they may click slightly but I feel that they were too good to throw away :)

Also used in the 1994 DOS game Iron Seed http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/iron-seed ???</info>
