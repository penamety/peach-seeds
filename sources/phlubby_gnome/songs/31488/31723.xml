 <info>Original version was conceived by Souji Taro. I finally had the energy to grab my favourite Axelay theme and throw it through the shredder. Figuratively speaking, of course. Now imagine that you are playing a 8-bit NES version of Axelay (yes, this is a chiptune, or at least trying to be one - I tried to stick as close to the NES limitations as possible).. the third level starts, and you take the blocky controller in your firm grasp. Your finger is hovering on the B button, ready to kick some alien invader arse again. It didn&#39;t take too get a taste of blood/metal/whatever - infact you are doing great! But suddenly..
