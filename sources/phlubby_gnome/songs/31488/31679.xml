 <info>This track is a remix of an old module by Azazel called &#34;fractured.ni&#34;. The only things left from the old module however are the vocals and the respective chord sequence. Practically everything else is my own.
I slowed the whole thing down a lot, for I wanted to go for a more dance-paced BPM.

Nothing mind-blowing in my opinion, just a few ideas thrown together.
Didn&#39;t take much time, after the initial trial-and-error syncing of the slowed vocals to the right BPM, it was a few day&#39;s work.
