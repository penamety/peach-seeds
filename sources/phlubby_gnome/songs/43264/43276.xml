This song was originally an S3M written for a diskmag that was finally
released about 6 months after it&#39;s original deadline! (That wasn&#39;t my
fault :) ) It was also part of Epinicion&#39;s BLT musicdisk (still in S3M
format) - I converted it to .IT for this CD, modifying very little
(just to take a little advantage of the instrument options) and I shoved
in a 16-bit version of the strings. It&#39;s almost identical to the original
file (ie. it doesn&#39;t *really* use volume envelopes or NNAs, which could
have made this so much easier (quicker) to write).

The time changes in this piece may make the rhythm *SEEM* stuffed when you
watch the pattern data...

Make sure you listen to at least order 10! That&#39;s when the real music
starts.

Hope you like this!</info>
