 <info>[i]HI ALL (?) AGAIN... A WEEK BEFORE RELEASE I DIDN&#39;T KNOW TO BE ON THE DISK YET AS I WASN&#39;T ON THE LIST OF IT AND DIDN&#39;T HAVE A TUNE ANYWAY... WELL, THEN SLASH ASKED IF I DID HAVE A TUNE AND I OF COURSE SAID &#34;SORRY NO&#34; AS SO I REMEMBERED. WELL COUPLE HOURS LATER I REALISED I DO HAVE A TUNE, MEANT FOR ANOTHER PRODUCTION THAT WAS CANCELLED (FOR NOW, I WILL MAKE A NEW TUNE NEXT YEAR GUYS :D) AND USED THAT ONE. AND THAT WAS THE LITTLE STORY OF MY SIMPLE CHIP. GREETS TO ALL AND THANKS FOR THE INVOLVED FOR KEEPING AMIGA CHIPDISKS ALIVE![/i]</info>
