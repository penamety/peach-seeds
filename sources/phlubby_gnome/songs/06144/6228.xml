 <info>&#34;The original name of this one was &#39;Funk for Sodomizers&#39;, but Tempest suggested that it&#39;s not a suitable name for a &#39;serious&#39; compo tune. :) I suppose I was still pretty much into pure funk at the time, no disco in this one.&#34;

Ranked 6th in the multichannel music compo at Assembly &#39;2k held in Hartwall Areena, Helsinki, Finland from 3rd to 6th August, 2000.</info>
