V.M.L.!

VERSE

This is our cigarette song,
(saying) that smokers could quit

smoke no more than five per day,
that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to teach

we don&#39;t care about smoking,
it took us all our money,
wonder why those schoolboys still are willing
to pay so much for cigarettes?

tobacco, pipe and cigar,
are all dangerous to one&#39;s health,
no matter if you&#39;re a bum or a nerd**,
don&#39;t take smoking as your habit

smoke no more than five per day,
that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to teach

V.M.L.!
V.M.L.!

CHORUS

we don&#39;t like smoking,
but tell about its disadvantages
smoking brings tar to lungs,
wet and sticky as (laughs)***

---
new lyrics after 1st verse &amp; chorus:

spoken:
no rollies for guys (the song title)

when the bass drum stops:

we don&#39;t like smoking,
and we neither love a pipe,
it might also depend on one&#39;s age
whether one smokes a rollie or a pipe

spoken: människor, röka inte [is swedish and means: people, do not smoke]

spoken: hey, put all the cigarettes off

*) V.M.L. = Vaajakosken Mieslaulajat (The Male Singers of Vaajakoski), Vaajakoski being probably the location of the school in which this song was made as a part of some video project
**) &#34;hikari&#34; = a person who gets high grades
***) at this point listener may expect to hear a word &#34;sperm&#34; since it would make a rhyme (tervaa - spermaa) but one hears laughs instead
