This is my first Analogue release.

I&#39;m pretty satisfied with the way this one turned out.  I was looking
to create the same feeling that I ended up making with this song, so
that&#39;s a definate plus.  I hope you all get some sort of enjoyment out
of this song.

In light of certain things, I would like to thank FM for considering me
to be a part of their musicdisk.  My only regret is that it didn&#39;t work
out due to things that were my fault anyway.  Thanks, guys, and I hope
that we can resolve things in the future.
