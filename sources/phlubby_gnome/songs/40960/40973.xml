Lyrics:

Digital artwork forever can&#39;t be cliché
Demoscene movement won&#39;t be  passé
All we need is friendship and creativity 
And some compos to show our ability

We are making demos all night long
Pixeling graphics that comes along
Making music for moving phong
Pushing code never seen so strong 

Pitiful ones says &#34;get out of the past!&#34; 
They claim &#34;yesterday won&#39;t be a blast! &#34; 
&#34;If you do things for free you&#39;re untoward!&#34;
&#34;Having fun is not enough of reward!&#34;

Music for moving phong
Code never seen so strong

Digital artwork forever can&#39;t be cliché
DemoScene movement won&#39;t be  passé
All we need is friendship and creativity 
And some compos to show our ability

We know it&#39;s hard to understand our goal
A culture based on this nerdy binary soul
Though there&#39;s something wise sceners knows
It&#39;s true: only lamers to LAN parties goes

Only lamers to LAN parties goes 
(repeated several times)
