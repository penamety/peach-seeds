                        CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME



Second contribution to BEST OF THE FANS III musicdisk.
Another long tune written by Harris, with long guitar solos that were
quite hard to track. Took me about 10 hours.

Thanks to Betrayer and Cadaver for the guitar samples and John Twynam and
Zoso for midifile and tab, they helped me a lot !

Hails to Dragon and Hakan, CroW, Amok, Deimos (i have no answer from him
since...long, long time), Friz, Corpse and all those who tracked a song
for BOTF3. Let&#39;s hope this one will be better than the 2nd edition.


Up the Irons ! (i will see them live September 9th in Paris, hope it will
really kick ass, but i suppose it will...)

If you are a Maiden fan or if you think this music sounds good, check the
others BOTF3 tunes on Hakan&#39;s Maiden Sound Archive (well, it&#39;s probably
the place where you got this mod from, i don&#39;t remember the url)

This song is the first track of the &#34;Somewhere In Time&#34; album and lasts
about 7&#39;20. Hope you like it !
