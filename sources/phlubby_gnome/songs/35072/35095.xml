 <info>2.Oath Of The Brave (6:00)

Once again an evil lord was rising,
far in the north where reigned the felon kings
Innocents died by unholy hands
spreading death and fear

The call for revenge burning in our veins,
our mighty armies brought down by their men
Our people were praying for their souls,
so we took our swords and we said:

  &#34;For our lakes, our mountains,
  our green forests and plains,
  we swear we&#39;ll be victorious and brave!

  We will fight out our way,
  we will ride night and day
  and from evil our land will be saved!&#34;

Legions of light, raise high your fists,
demons approach with deep blood lust
Lord of the dark, your end has come
Soon you will be expelled to hell your home! 

  &#34;For our lakes, our mountains,
  our green forests and plains,
  we swear we&#39;ll be victorious and brave!

  We will fight out our way,
  we will ride night and day
  and from evil our land will be saved!</info>
