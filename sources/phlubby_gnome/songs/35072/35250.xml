 <info>MAS_UTrack_V003 The Lair Of The Orange Machine  By: Killer Fish (Todd Showalter)   of Late Nite Software Labs
   --------------------------------
Written on or about Mar/94.  (c)
  This song took insanely long  to write, especially considering that it is rather small.  It did spend a lot of time on the back burner waiting for UltraTracker to get a Jump command.  I hope  one comes out soon, but I&#39;ve    decided that this song was a pot that I&#39;d been staring at far too long.  If I finish it, perhaps  it will boil, and UltraTracker  will get a Jump command.  It&#39;s a luck thing I&#39;m trying here, so  don&#39;t break the mojo.
             Anyways, as I was blathering  above, this song&#39;s been about in my &#34;to be completed&#34; directory  for a while.  I believe that it dates back to the days of the   original UltraTracker 1.0 (most of my sample archive has since  become UWF files).
                I hope you enjoy the song.      I&#39;d like to continue to fill  your life with my vast wisdom,  but I&#39;ve just run out of space.
   Gotta speed, keid...
