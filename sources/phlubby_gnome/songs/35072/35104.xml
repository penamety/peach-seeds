 <info>WRATH OF THE DEAD - 3&#39;54



Written, composed and tracked by Malekith
Vocals by Cadaver
Samples by Betrayer, Cadaver and some others... thanx a lot


This song was supposed to be released for the true-metal mod group Iron
Assault, but since i&#39;ve had no news of the organizer Deimos since July, I
decided to release it while making my website. So here it is. The song was
written in November &#39;98 and has been constantly improved and updated until
now.

I&#39;d like to say a big HI to all my friends from the scene, and to thank
all those who helped me by sending feedback after the release of TA4 and
&#34;Ahead On The Way&#34;. Special thanks go to Cadaver for making these great
vocals !

The lyrics are in the text file that is normally included in the zip.




...And if you have something to say, go and contact me before the mad
souls of the dead damn you forevermore, you poor mortal !

reality :)

Lyrics:

Wrath Of The Dead


Seven years I have been dead,
out of purgatory I am back
And you will not be spared,
prepare for my last attack !

Seven years ago you killed me
now, be paralyzed by fear
Because my soul has been set free
...well, your death is near !

	Be afraid, be afraid
	be afraid of the wrath of the dead
	Be afraid, be afraid
	I will rip off your head !

I won’t wait any longer
and my last strike will be fatal !
Now I’m getting stronger,
I have become immortal !

And as the Reaper is your God,
go and join her, bloody murderer !
Now you’ll drown in your own blood !
Prepare for a great slaughter !

	[repeat chorus]

At any place you can hide...
I can read fright in your eyes
I’ll kill you to save my pride,
the Beast inside me will arise !

I’ll torment you until you scream,
I want to hear you cry !
Then you shall make endless dreams...
the time has come to Die !

	[repeat chorus 2x]
