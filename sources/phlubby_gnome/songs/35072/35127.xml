 <info>Orchestral tune inspired by music from the movie &#34;The Rock&#34; composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, Nick-Glennie Smith and Hans Zimmer. 

I think this tune has a great movie-atmosphere, consisting of different parts trying to portray different moods/settings. I tried to visualize different happenings in a movie while composing this song.

Most samples are &#34;borrowed&#34; from the Lizardking song &#34;Age of Legends&#34;.</info>
