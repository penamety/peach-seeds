lyrics :  (length : 6&#39;39)

You think you&#39;re to rule over mankind
People should kneel each time they see you
You own all their bodies and their minds
Because you are a new Messiah

Then you go and preach your own gospel
Made of hypocrisy and lies
Men are to do everything you tell
All those who&#39;re destroyed and mesmerised


 You say, they do
 You&#39;re man, them too
 But you&#39;re special

 You fight, they hate
 You hold their fate
 Under control           [CHORUS]

 And for them there&#39;s nothing but you
 Messiah


You consider you are a holy being
Their God, their Devil, you own their souls
Don&#39;t you realize that you&#39;re nothing
You&#39;ve fallen under Satan&#39;s control

[repeat]

 And for them there&#39;s nothing but you
 Messiah

[solo + repeat]

 You act the way the devils do
 You have them pawns, but you&#39;re one too
 And I am not afraid of you

 Until the day I defeat you
