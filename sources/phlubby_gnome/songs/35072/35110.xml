 <info>INFINITE DREAMS - 6:09

Written by IRON MAIDEN (Harris)
Covered by Malekith in November &#39;98

Tracked exclusively for BEST OF THE FANS II musicdisk, organized by Dragon
and Hakan Jerning

I REMOVED THIS F---ING GUITAR LOOPING ! :-))


Some samples were taken from mods by Cadaver, Betrayer and MCD.
Greets to them and :
 Dragon and Hakan, of course
 Friz
 Galahad and all the RED members
 and ALL the metal trackers


By the way : I don&#39;t know who made the Snaredrum and Bassdrum samples I
used, just cause I found them in several mods by different trackers,
without any word about them. The only thing is that these samples are
FUCKING GOOD !


I also tracked &#34;Revelations&#34; for this musicdisk. If you like this one,
MAKE SURE to download the others !

This was not as hard as I expected, mainly because this song has an easy
solo (not like those from Piece Of Mind). It took me about 6 hours
(except for recording and looking for samples)

UP THE IRONS !!!!!
