 <info>Malekith presents :


                        DIE WITH YOUR BOOTS ON



Written by IRON MAIDEN (Harris, Dickinson, Smith)
Arranged and tracked by Malekith for the BEST OF THE FANS III music disk



One of my favorite Maiden tracks, and my third cover from the album Piece
Of Mind which is, in my opinion, one of the best heavy metal albums i have
ever heard.

And now, the credits :

 - Rhythm guitar samples by Betrayer
 - Lead guitar samples by Cadaver
 - Bass and drums by... i really don&#39;t know, these samples were all ripped
    here and there, without any name to credit

Greets to Hakan and Dragon, Betrayer, Cadaver, Crow, Amok, Corpse and
everyone who supports heavy metal in all its forms - and, last but not
least, to the new Maiden. Bruce and Adrian back... the band will rule
again. UP THE IRONS !

playing time : 5&#39;35
max channels : 14
tracking time : about 5 hours of basic tracking (3 for the solos), plus a
 few more of fine tuning, arranging the solos, finding one or two samples
 missing, setting pannings, and trying to make this mod better and better
just for your little ears... so, if you don&#39;t like it... :))))))

btw. the vocal channels are #15 and 16, if you don&#39;t like the vocal
sample...
