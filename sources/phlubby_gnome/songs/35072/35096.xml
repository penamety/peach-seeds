 <info>3.Holy Forest (5:40)

Crossing down the secret paths
that led to the old valley,
Riding through the sacred woods,
the ancient sanctuary
where lay, dead, our old gods...

On our way we found the trace
of the evil invasion
Strange animals ran around us
- nature&#39;s perversion
And their tormented eyes...

Balance was broken between darkness and light
Life was corrupted by an evil might
The earth was screaming, full of deep pain
And we heeded her call across the mountains...

  Holy forest, crying our names
  Mighty and brave, we have heard your call
  For the salvation of our beloved lands
  The dark reign of evil will now fall!

The sacred flame of life won&#39;t fade
smothered by Algoth&#39;s claw
As ancient prophecies said,
four warriors will crush the foe
And I know we are the Ones!

Balance was broken between darkness and light
Life was corrupted by an evil might
The earth was screaming, full of deep pain
And we heeded her call across the mountains...

  Holy forest, crying our names
  Mighty and brave, we have heard your call
  For the salvation of our beloved lands
  The dark reign of evil will now fall!</info>
