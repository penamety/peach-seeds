 <info>MAS_UTrack_V003  Captain Nemo&#39;s Last Stand...   By: Killer Fish (Todd Showalter)   of Late Nite Software Labs   --------------------------------Written on or about Oct/93.  (c)  I would like to take just as  little responsibility for this  little number as possible.  I   was in a crazed stupor when I   wrote it, and I&#39;m just sick     enough to have enjoyed the      results.  Don&#39;t ask me why.       The major reason for writing  this was a nasty bass line I    came up with, and memory of that cheap animated show &#34;The Under- Sea Adventures Of Captain Nemo&#34; or something like that.  It used to run when I was a lil&#39; nipper and I&#39;ll never forget how awful that show was so...               If anyone wants or needs to   contact me for a LEGITIMATE     reason (if I get adds I&#39;ll find you and maim you) I can be      reached by snail-mail at:
