 <info>1.The Sign Of Fate (2:07)

Legions from the north
came to invade our southern lands
Drawn by lust for blood and gold,
under a madman&#39;s command

Overpowered and defeated,
our wise men soon cried
Tears of despair flowing
at the sight of all who&#39;d died

But far away, beneath crimson skies,
Four brothers stood up and swore to rise

Revenge from damnation 
Suffer in oblivion
From the scarlet flows and mourning shadows,
Freedom and life would rise again...</info>
