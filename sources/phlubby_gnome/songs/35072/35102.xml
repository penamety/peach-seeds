 <info>BLOOD BROTHERS (Iron Maiden)
--------------

And if you&#39;re taking a look through the garden of life,
what do you think you&#39;d expect you would see ?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
and, in the river, reflections of me

Just for a second, a glimpse of my father I see
and in a movement, he beckons to me
And in a moment, the memories are all that remain,
and all the wounds are reopening again

  We&#39;re blood brothers...

And as you look all around at the world in dismay,
what do you see, do you think we have learned ?
Not if you&#39;re taking a look at the war torn affray,
out in the streets where the babies are burned...

  We&#39;re blood brothers...

There are times when I feel I&#39;m afraid for the world
There are times I&#39;m ashamed of us all
When you&#39;re floating on all the emotion you feel,
and reflecting the good and the bad

Will we ever know what the answer to life really is ?
Can you really tell me what life is ?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
could be swept away by fate&#39;s own hand...

  We&#39;re blood brothers...

When you think that we&#39;ve used all our chances
and the chance to make everything right,
keep on making the same old mistakes
makes untipping the balance so easy...
When we&#39;re living our lives on the edge,
say a prayer on the book of the dead...

  We&#39;re blood brothers...

... and if you&#39;re taking a walk through the garden of life...
