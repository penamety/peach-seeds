 <info>Second part of &#39;The Assault&#39;. Also inspired by music from the movie &#34;The Rock&#34; composed by Harry Gregson-Williams, Nick-Glennie Smith and Hans Zimmer. 

I&#39;ve also tried to capture the movie atmosphere in this song, and it is divided into seperate parts attempting to portray different scenarios in a movie. This song is in my opinion better technically performed than the &#34;First Stage&#34; (stereo effects and so on).

Most samples are identical to the ones in &#39;The Assault - First Stage&#39;, and are &#34;borrowed&#34; from the Lizardking song &#34;Age of Legends&#34;.</info>
