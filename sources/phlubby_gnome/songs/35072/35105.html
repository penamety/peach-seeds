<br />Additional Information:<br /><i><p>SACRIFICE THE RAPPER</p>

<p>Written, composed and recorded by Malekith in May 2000</p>

<p>For long I had wanted to make a joke-song, and when I got my new ZOOM<br />GFX-707 guitar effect processor, I thought it would be an excellent<br />occasion to test it :))<br />So I found the idea and wrote stupid lyrics during a philosophy class :-)<br />Then, I composed this bloody shit in one hour, played and recorded it (I<br />used a microphone plugged into my SB Live 128 soundcard). Finally one of<br />my friends growled the verses, and I tried to howl the chorus :))</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;ve understood this is not serious at all :)<br />So have fun with that shit !<br />Inspiration got from Children Of Bodom and some Cadaver stuff :)</p>

<p>Hails : Cadaver, Dragon, Hakan, HolyBlood, Darkium, Razor, ChristCrusha,<br />Neomancia, and everyone who likes this :)</p>

<p>LYRICS :</p>

<p>A primate is dancing on a computer beat,<br />his words are full of hatred, his mind is full of shit.<br />So boring and stupid, he fills our ears with crap,<br />annoyed by his insults, we set him a trap.</p>

<p>The rapper is locked up in an unholy cave<br />with his fellows the rats, he is waiting for a grave !<br />But time has come to kill, torture and break his bones,<br />we try to smash his balls but we find out he has none !</p>

<p> For all your crimes, you&#39;ll have to pay.<br /> At this point ends your bloody way...</p>

<p> SACRIFICE THE RAPPER !<br /> KILL HIM NOW !<br /> SACRIFICE THE RAPPER !<br /> LET&#39;S SPILL ALL HIS BLOOD !</p>

<p>With an old rusted blade, the bastard is impaled.<br />On a big wooden cross, he is finally nailed !<br />We watch him slowly die, crucified upside down<br />and tied in a porker&#39;s skin, he is thrown underground !</p>

<p> The word of violence you spread.<br /> By your own law you will be dead !</p>

<p> SACRIFICE THE RAPPER !<br /> KILL HIM NOW !<br /> SACRIFICE THE RAPPER !<br /> LET&#39;S SPILL ALL HIS BLOOD !</p>
