 <info>MAS_UTrack_V003 Attack of the Analog Sequencer  By: Killer Fish (Todd Showalter)   of Late Nite Software Labs
   --------------------------------
Written on or about Oct/93.  (c)
  This was written in what can  best be described as a fevered  flurry of activity.  It is my   attempt to produce the type of  music that Tangarine Dream (one of the best bands ever to exist,in by humble opinion) was making in the early- to mid-seventies.   I know the song is not very   wide (in terms of channels used) but I refuse to pump in sound   just to make it wider.  I liked this the way it came out, and   I&#39;m keeping it.  Nyah.
            Greetz to:
                      Purple Motion: The Fishtro and the Starshine S3M were awesome!
   C.C.Catch: I love the stuff   you did with 669s (Elemental    Warriors, etc), and the Nothing On music disk!
                    Ryan Cramer: The Power Of Wind is a beautiful tune, and I like the rest of your music too.
       Anyway, enjoy the music and   I&#39;ll catch you later.  Gotta    buzz...
