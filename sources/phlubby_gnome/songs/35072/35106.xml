 <info>REVELATIONS - 6&#39;50


by Iron Maiden - Cover by Malekith
Tracked for &#34;BEST OF THE FANS II&#34; musicdisk

One of my favorite Maiden songs, I first wanted to track it for BOTF 1 but
I didn&#39;t have enough good samples to do an &#34;above-average&#34; mod. Then I
found some good metal mods, I asked permission to rip some samples (mainly
solo guitar and drums) and now, here it is...


Clean guitar parts redone with Hybrido&#39;s pack. I kept the original samples
&#39;cos i wasn&#39;t gonna do the whole module again (something else to do :-))
Original samples by Zack and Betrayer.
