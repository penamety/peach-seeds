--------------------------------
Written on or about Mar/94.  (c)
  This song is dedicated to my  
abiding obsession with Japanese 
Anime.  Don&#39;t ask me what the   
two have to do with each other. 
  Anyways, enjoy the music, and 
I would like to appologize in   
advance for any disco-like stuff
in the song.  It&#39;s not my fault,
really.  Blame someone else.    
  I said that I would eventually
deliver an ULT file that was    
wider than 10 channels, and here
it is.  Don&#39;t bug me about the  
quality, that wasn&#39;t part of the
deal.  I&#39;ll work on making the  
the next one sound better.      
  If you&#39;re looking for a really
good sample for making chords,  
get a copy of the sample called 
&#34;Polysynth Lead I&#34;, above.  Its 
really quite good to work with, 
and it is devoid of irritating  
harmonics, so chords don&#39;t sound
odd with it.                    
  Well, I&#39;m just about out of   
scrawling space, so I&#39;ll sign   
off now.  Gotta speed, keid...  </info>
