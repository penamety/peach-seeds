 <info>Back in the 80s again. I had some incredible fun with the horde of percussion in this track (cowbells FTW!). Combined some analog power with digital smoothness and voil√°, more italodisco is born.

The whole composition took just two days or so, I&#39;m getting quite fast at this genre now!

I finally found an equalizer, compressor and limiter I like to use, and I think it can be heard on this one. I&#39;ll need to do some remastering with older tracks I guess.

I tried to prevent being repetitive, and still the track has 6:50, which is probably one of the longest dance tracks I ever produced.

Other than that, nothing is new. Standard chord progression, standard buildup techniques. The same old italo story which never gets boring :)

Finished the mastering touches on Feb 10 2012 instead of working on my thesis :P</info>
