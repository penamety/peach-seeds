 <info>6.Face The Storm (7:48)

&#34;Lord of this kingdom, hold back those fiends
Dark hordes are coming to damn our souls
Through raging thunder on (the) battlefield, 
Glory awaits those who will face the storm...&#34;

As soon as we could see the first light of dawn,
we left the old village, silent and alone
We rode through the valley, in the endless fields,
searching for the evil lord

But soon black clouds covered the blue morning sky,
hail started to fall, dead leaves began to fly 
An evil presence was about to reveal:
we grabbed the hilts of our swords...

  Signs of evil we had seen
  Mighty and brave we had been
  Finally we had found our fate

Then appeared before us a mighty Demon,
this nightmare&#39;s being the bastard had summoned
Surrounded by lightning, trapped and alone,
we would be victorious or dead!

We fought hard and long, wielding our holy blades,
but so tough and strong was this lord of the Shade
This merciless battle was wearing us down
Our strength had begun to fade...

  Signs of evil we had seen
  Mighty and brave we had been
  Finally we had found our fate

&#34;Fight for your lost cause, poor stupid men...
Your heads will be shown throughout the land!
Algoth the Great will come, take you to hell&#34;

But we are the Warriors of the Prophecy
and your death is our destiny;
you can&#39;t prevent our victory!</info>
