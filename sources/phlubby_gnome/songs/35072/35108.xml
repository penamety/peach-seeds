 <info>MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE



Written by Iron Maiden
Covered by Malekith for BEST OF THE FANS III musicdisk.

Well, i don&#39;t have much to say here... A fast heavy tune with a very quiet
intro, a good old Maiden song with Di&#39;Anno. I didn&#39;t use any &#34;vocal&#34;
sample because I think the guitar melodies are enough (the vocal parts are
nearly the same).

Thanx to Betrayer and Cadaver for samples.
Hails to Dragon, Hakan and everyone I have forgotten, I don&#39;t write all
the names but you know who you are ! UP THE IRONS !

Playing time : 4&#39;07. Hope you like this !
