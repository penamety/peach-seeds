 <info>5.Heroes Of The Last Chance (7:01)

Day turned to night so long ago,
our weariness had begun to show
We had to find a place to stop for the night

A village small was waiting near
People dreaming dreams full of fear
until wiped away by rays of the light...
 
So pale and sad was the look on their face,
living in this grim and forbidding place
Disturbing news from the fields not far away
 
Was rumoured, there a black fire burned
Unnatural storms, some did not return
after work had ended for the day
 
We would have to go and investigate,
even if it meant riding to our fate...

  We&#39;re the Heroes of the last chance,
  riders of the night
  Against terror and violence,
  we will forever fight.

  With our fists raised high into the air
  we&#39;ll ride to the battlefield
  So we know this bloody nightmare
  will end, destroyed by our steel.</info>
