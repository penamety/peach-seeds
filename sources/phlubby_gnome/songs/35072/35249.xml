 <info>MAS_UTrack_V003            No Time!             By: Killer Fish (Todd Showalter)   of Late Nite Software Labs 
  --------------------------------
Written on or about Mar/94.  (c)
  This song was written as a    response to about 12 deadlines, all of which descended on me    from out of the clear blue sky.   I spent a week of frantic work to get everything done, and when I had nothing left that needed  to be done, this song is how I  burned off the rest of my vast  supply of adrenalin before I    crawled into bed and fell into  a deep, healing sleep.
            As usual, I have managed to   use a 32 voice tracker to create a song that uses less than 10   channels.  I&#39;m working on wider music files (trust me...) but   they won&#39;t be released until I  can listen to them without      openly cringing.  May take a    while...
