 <info>4.Light And Shade (5:23)

Old warriors in the ground,
lying without a sound,
dead by the sword in this wide plain

Soon they began to rise;
in the night cold as ice
were standing those who had been slain...

Undead hordes rising up in pain,
and soon they would be crushed again...

  Mighty warriors of light,
  behind us darkness will fade!
  We will chase you through the night,
  and you will die by our blades!

Engaged by the undead -
but the Lord of the Shade
suddenly appeared in our light

Algoth was hiding near,
in his eyes, a flash of fear
as he ran away in the night

His treacherous assault had failed,
and now the Children would prevail...

  Mighty warriors of light,
  behind us darkness will fade!
  We will chase you through the night,
  and you will die by our blades!

Dark wizard, black warrior,
hear the Wrath of (the) Saviours
Fear our swords, fear our hands
for soon your race will end

You, servant of gloom,
you&#39;ll run to your doom
And we swear we&#39;ll find you
to take you to Hell!</info>
