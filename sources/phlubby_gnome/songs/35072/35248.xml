   --------------------------------
Written on or about Aug/93.  (c)
This is my first experience with Ultra Tracker, and I like it. It could really use a JUMP effect, though... 
                        This song was based on an old idea I had for a song, years    ago.  I hope you enjoy the song as much as I enjoyed composing  it.

     I love the music you guys have written.  Demos come and go, but a good tune can stand the test  of time.  I&#39;ve heard 4 track MODfiles that blow the hell out of most popular music on the market these days, and the artists     above are probably THE best in  the tracker-composing field, and are using 8 to 32 tracks.         I&#39;ve just run out of writing  space (32 lines).  Adieu...                     Killer Fish</info>
