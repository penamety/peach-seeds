Possibly my biggest endeavour yet. This song has over 50 audio tracks and instruments and it took a full week to complete. Actually, &#39;complete&#39; is not the right word, it&#39;s merely in a listenable state now ;) The 2nd part with the guitars is losely based on an old idea I had for an .xm track back in 2004.

As always, I hope you&#39;ll enjoy! :)</info>
