 <info>As you may guess, this tune was made as a joke.
I composed this one for a game on PowerTV console,
it was a 8 channel chiptune with 8 bit samples.
Later, I brought back original 16 bit samples
and decide to release it on &#39;Toy SongS 3&#39; musicdisk.
I found myself singing silly melody during listening
to this tune, so I quickly plugged a microphone and
sampled my own voice. What is most funny, the vocal
pretending to be quite serious, while music has
awful chip samples. It&#39;s so easy to make a bad sound,
but nowdays it&#39;s even more easy to make a good sound :)
So, I processed vocal and left the rest as it was -
who care?.. And of course, it&#39;s not a &#34;ragga&#34; style :)</info>
