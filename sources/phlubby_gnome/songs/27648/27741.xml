 <info>Composed by me in 2003.
Tracked for PostMODism musicdisk in 2005.
Dedicated to old friend whose birthday I missed a few years.
Also dedicated to my wife Helen, this song was composed the night before our wedding anniversary, so I played this tune next morning for her. Useless present, isn&#39;t it?
Bass was made in Psycle Tracker, guitars recorded with M-Audio DUO. Drums are sampled from audio tape, loops rendered in Impulse Tracker.
4 channel Amiga MOD as a result.</info>
