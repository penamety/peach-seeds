Lyrics:
Coming home after a long, long war
Coming home after a dozen of walks
Coming home after a long, long war
Coming home after a dozen of wars

We are out of wind
We have pockmarked chin
We have lots of water
We turn the other cheek and we win

One thousand stories and there&#39;s always more
We&#39;ve been offered one more lap to go
In my hand I hold a key
It&#39;s dear to me &#39;cause I know where it leads

We are out of wind
We have pockmarked chin
We have all this water
We turn the other cheek with a grin</info>
