well here&#39;s the song  
i told you about in my
previous production.  
it&#39;s a long track,yes,
again, but that&#39;s a   
normal phenomenon     
in the drum &#39;n bass   
scene... so all you   
3minute-shortsong-    
raveonly-lowlife shut 
up, or delete this xm 
right away, you can&#39;t 
make me move. ha!     
greetinx to all scene 
geezers around the    
world worth greeting, 
and to all my personal
friends..... who will 
probably only get to  
hear this on tape,    
&#39;cos they don&#39;t have  
the proper stuph for  
these musicphilez ;)  
                      
of course special     
greetz &#39;n respect to  
all drum &#39;n bass fans 
around the globe..    
( i guess most of &#39;em 
 are english ;) )     
and i hope one of     
the following guys    
gets to hear this:    
                      
LTJ Bukem / PFM       
Peshay / Goldie       
Future Bound / Skanna 
Aphrodite /  Photek   
M-Beat / Alex Reece,  
keep up the very very 
good work! you&#39;re     
music elevates our    
minds &#39;n stuph...     
at least it&#39;s very    
relaxing music you    
bring forth....       
                      
but &#39;nuff said... i&#39;m 
wasting time typing   
crap here and i don&#39;t 
WANT to fill up this
