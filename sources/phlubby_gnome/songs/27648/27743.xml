 <info>I composed this tune long time ago, played on 2 guitars with Tarh/SandS, tracked bass and drums in self made tracker on BK-0010 home computer and recorded it to the tape. Quality was really terrible :)
This version based on high quality samples (recorded with pro gears) downsampled to fit into MOD format. It&#39;s concept o PostMODism musicdisk!

Two guitars and bass played and sampled by me, flute and drums recorded by Tangerine (all live), only moog sound was made with software emulator.</info>
