 <info>was meant for TUM09 tracked music competition. turns out the rules forbid renoise, so streamed music instead.

intention behind this song was to make renoise sound as much as a sequencer with expensive vstis as possible, but using only samples and renoises built in capabilities, at the same time staying below the &#34;magical&#34; boundary of 1,44MB. consequently, there is some naughty manual fakery hidden in here! :)</info>
