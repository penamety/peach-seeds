Lyrics:
sun, may you shine down on us
let us rejoice in your warmth in delight,
in delight

come, sit by me on the ground
we&#39;ll chase away the demons
fly, over the hills, of memories

Let&#39;s drink this toast rise it high
to the end of mosaic days
let&#39;s seek out the flaming sun
beneath the night that is so dark

the light will come through
the life will shine through
the light will come through
the life will shine through
shine through

Don&#39;t walk away now
see the mornings dawning in all its beauty
and brightness

stay, ley by me make no sound
we&#39;ll hear the insects building worlds
feel the earth moving on
moving on

Let&#39;s drink this toast rise it high
to the end of mosaic days
let&#39;s seek out the flaming sun
beneath the night that is so dark

the light will come through
the life will shine through
the light will come through
the life will shine through
shine through</info>
