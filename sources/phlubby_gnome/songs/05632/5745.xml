Prism and Edge of Unexpected present:



         Remote Control

      finished in December &#39;93



This is our contribution to The Party 3

PC music compo. Too bad there aren&#39;t

separate 4- and multichannel compos, 

for this was originally a 4-ch. .MOD...



This song shouldn&#39;t be played with MM 

because StarScream decided to create

his own standards for volslides, BPM&#39;s,

portamentos and other effects.



Some greets.....:

Purple Motion &amp; Skaven /FC, Sonic PC 

members, Turtle/Accession &amp; Trixter

Many thanks to PSi / FC for letting us

use his module player in the compo!</info>
