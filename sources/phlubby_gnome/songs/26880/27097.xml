 <info>Composed by matrix on the 3th of may in the year 1992.

this zak was inspired by the great movie and a picture drawn by wyatt, the gfx-man of our group : gentlemen!

info update!
later we changed the name of the group to &#34;dolby c&#34; and this zak actually became music-compo winner at a party in hungary.</info>
