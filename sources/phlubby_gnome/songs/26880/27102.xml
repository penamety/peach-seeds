 <info>Transplanetary cruise  written by TOALNKOR of REALTECH For the party report

Hahahahaha....No original samples, but all ripped from Skaven / FC ....

In 2196 AD, an huge ship called Rama II flew close to the earth. A crew from the A.S.I. Had to explore It. As the starship left our solar system, three people were still on board. They are still alive, but On a transplanetary cruise!
