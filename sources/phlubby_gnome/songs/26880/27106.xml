Lyrics:
I thought it would be easy but it was not 
I&#39;m back at the start with a blunderbuss 

Always had a lot of things 
Always had a lot of things 
Always had a lot of things to do 

Always had a lot of things 
Always had a lot of things 
Always had a lot of things to do 

I thought it would be easy but it was not 
It&#39;s proven, it&#39;s proven with my blunderbuss 
The feeble marks it leaves when it triggers 
You can have my blunderbuss 
As long as you will promise to polish it and laugh with it and then 
Kill a lot of men with it 

I always had a lot of things 
Always had a lot of things 
Always had a lot of things to do 

Always had a lot of things 
Always had a lot of things 
And it will grow and then loose all sense I have</info>
