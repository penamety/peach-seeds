2x
you set me free
together we stand strong
right next to me
where you belong

you are my dream
you light my day
you are my sunshine
but you&#39;re far away

you ride the skies
ride the stars
pure as ice 
is what you are

love makes you blind
you cannot see
what&#39;s there to find
inside of me

there&#39;s no escape
our love is strong
just you and me
no right or wrong

bright as the sun 
you light my way
I cannot think
of a better day

the birds are free
the sky is blue
life is a dream
and so are you

2x
you set me free
together we stand strong
right next to me
where you belong

you are my dream
you light my day
you are my sunshine
but you&#39;re far away

you ride the skies
ride the stars
prue as ice 
is what you are
