 <info>Winner of the streamed music compo @ Compusphere 2007.


I lie awake, watching the heavens
Pretty soon, it might be too late
Feeling victimised, burning like vengeance
All this waiting is trying my faith

When all of this is over
You&#39;ll still live on
Through the void eternal
Echoes of your song

And while stars are dying
Your rain comes through
To stop the fire burning
When everything is new

CHORUS:
I want to soar [along? alone on?] your horizon
Drifting through your everlasting night
Test my faith for you that I believe in
For an infinite eternity in time

Frozen in time on the verge of escaping
Circling indefinitely, resting in peace
Matter colliding, sustaining no motion
Cutting the heartbeat, all movement will cease

When all of this is over
And only you remain
&#39;Cross the distant spaces
May I run once again

And while stars are dying
Your rain comes through
To stop the fire burning
And everything is new

(repeat CHORUS x 2)
