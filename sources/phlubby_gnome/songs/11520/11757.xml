 <info>The name of the song comes a from discussion between hypnodick and E. Aeroflot at Assembly &#39;99. The boys having spent an extended period of time awake in the dark party arena were a little confused about the bright natural light coming in from one of the exits on top of a flight of stairs. The silhouettes of people in the doorway seemed to be dancing so they figured it must be a screen showing a rave party video. Such videos are, naturally, broadcast by Jamming TV.

Hypnodick originally wrote the module, raina touched it up(?) later. (At least the drum track and some of the solos and production sound like mine -raina).</info>
