 <info>What happens when you try to combine the very nice voice of Rose with a remixed 8-bit-track from the “C64” composed by Marc Fischer ?!

Another Remix ;)

Actually i also used some parts of the vocals by Shannon Hurley’s “Shame” (thats why i upload the here too). The remix has a lil 80s touch to it, which fits the voice very good. But i know i have a strange taste -.-

Hopefully this works for you…
Because i really like the original song in the way it is, my remix had to go in a completely different direction…i just hope that Rose &amp; Shannon dont mind what i did to their voice !?

Anyway….
Enjoy the listening !! </info>
