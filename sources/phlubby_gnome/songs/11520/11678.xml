 <info>[i]Lyrics:

a little girl is dreaming of the sky looking for the love she heard about
she wonders if it&#39;s all a lie and then she starts to shout

why can&#39;t i have that feeling, why can&#39;t i fall in love?
why does noone care what i&#39;m dreaming of?

why can&#39;t i find the feeling, why can&#39;t i have my love?
is it too much to ask a little girl dreaming of
wonderful butterflies asking me to join them
but then i realized i&#39;m dreaming alone

a little girl is dreaming of the sky looking for the love she heard about
she wonders if it&#39;s all a lie and then she starts to shout

why can&#39;t i share my feeling, why can i never find my love?
why does noone truly know what i&#39;m dreaming of?[/i]</info>
