 <info>A little piano-version of a very great original composition by Michael (Z.) Land.
The soundeffects at the beginning and at the end are from the original soundtrack. I had to add some notes for a bridge (that connects theme 1 &amp; 2) and at the very end just to give the track a final note and a (hopefully) unique ending (instead of a fade-out ;)).</info>
