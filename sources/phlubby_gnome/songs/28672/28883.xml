Lyrics:
Why so serious?

He doesn&#39;t like that. Not. One. Bit.

Let&#39;s put a smile on that face!

[My father] was... a drinker. And a fiend. And one night he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn&#39;t like that. Not. One. Bit. So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me, and he says, &#34;Why so serious?&#34; He comes at me with the knife. &#34;Why so serious?&#34; He sticks the blade in my mouth. &#34;Let&#39;s put a smile on that face!&#34; Aaand...

Why so serious?
