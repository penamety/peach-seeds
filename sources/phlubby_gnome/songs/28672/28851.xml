 <info>Lyrics:
Mein Hut, der hat drei Ecken,
Drei Ecken hat mein Hut.
Und hätt&#39; er nicht drei Ecken,
So wär&#39;s auch nicht mein Hut.

Mein Hut, der hat drei Ecken,
Drei Eck... agh...
Nonono stopstopstopstopstopstopstop...

I never wanted to do this. I hate it.
I&#39;ve always... I&#39;ve always wanted...
I&#39;ve always wanted to be... a demoscener!

Leaping from party to party
From the mighty Breakpoint
To the sunny inércia
With my favourite PC by my side
I would sing! And sing! And sing!

Oh, I&#39;m a scener and I&#39;m OK
I code all night and I booze all day
He&#39;s a scener and he&#39;s OK
He codes all night and he boozes all day

I code good demos, I track great tunes,
I pixel in just 2D
On Easter I go to Breakpoint,
And booze watching the big screen

He codes good demos, he tracks great tunes,
He pixels in just 2D
On Easter he goes to Breakpoint,
And boozes watching the big screen

Oh, I&#39;m a scener and I&#39;m OK (He&#39;s a scener and he&#39;s OK)
I code all night and I booze all day (He codes all night and he boozes all day)

I watch some demos, I booze some more,
I like to be 31337.
The night is just too young,
so I go and play Quake3

He watches some demos, he boozes some more,
He likes to be 31337.
The night is just too young,
so he goes and plays Quake3...?

Oh, I&#39;m a scener and I&#39;m OK (He&#39;s a scener and he&#39;s OK)
I code all night and I booze all day (He codes all night and he boozes all day)

I code and track, I paint and... stuff,
I play with my PC
I wish I&#39;d be a gamer,
Just me and my joystick!

He codes and tracks, he paints and... stuff,
He plays with his PC...?
With his PC?
He&#39;s a gamer, oh Jesus Christ, what a lamer oh my god / Oh yo, fucking incredible...

Oh, I&#39;m a scener and I&#39;m OK (He&#39;s a scener and he&#39;s OK)
I code all night and I booze all day (He codes all night and he boozes all day)
Oh, I&#39;m a scener and I&#39;m OK (He&#39;s a scener and he&#39;s OK)
I code all night and I booze all day (He codes all night and he boozes all day)</info>
