 <info>From biglionmusic.com:

&#34;This is one of the three new songs I debuted at MAGFest 7 - An FM journey into an epic past where metallic wizards do battle on high windy cliffs with guitars and lightning. Dedicated to Wizwars, who couldnâ€™t be at Magfest, and who was deeply missed in an otherwise incredible chiptune concert.&#34;</info>
