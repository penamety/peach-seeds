 <info>&#34;300 Days of the BOFH&#34;	
almost a jokesong in	
the spirit of Manowar	
by Cadaver 9/2000.	
	
lyrics:	
Thunder and lightning	
in the server room,	
the engineer now	
declares the doom for	
all who don&#39;t obey the	
lusers&#39; call	
	
Backups be taken every	
week, boot the NT &#39;cos	
of memory leak, once	
in a week it will fall	
	
300 days of the BOFH,	
fire and brimstone	
300 days of the BOFH,	
once again facing the	
army of lusers alone	
	
When the servers have	
crashed hard the BOFHs	
will never get far,	
the leash of new age	
on their belts	
	
After 300 days of hell	
one of the BOFHs must	
bid farewell,	
glorifying the pain he	
has felt	
	
When the packets flow	
and the green lights	
glow you won&#39;t know	
they exist, but once	
again shit comes down	
like a divine fist	
	
	
Greetings: Dominus	
Einherjar Tuska Kuolo	
Å½lecmt Galahad Hakan	
Arahwn Dragon Malekith	
Ari Hybrido Amanojaku	
Daoloth Skarf Razor	
Assassin Ansgaros Dnd	
+ rest of metalscene	
	
This is maybe my first	
metalmod where lyrics	
are taken from real	
life :-)
