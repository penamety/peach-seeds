010	This party version is	
011	unoptimized. The 32	
012	channels are not 100%	
013	used. It started out	
014	as a full 32 channel	
015	1 pattern tune, but as	
016	the tune was built up,	
017	several channels were	
018	made redundant.	
019		
020	A total optimized and	
021	rewritten track will b	
022	released soon, though!
