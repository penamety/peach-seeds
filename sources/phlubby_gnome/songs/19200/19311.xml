Lyrics:
I&#39;m still haunted in my dreams
Waking up with awful screams
Feel so lost and lone at night

I have tried to understand
The things you used to do to me
You should just have let me be

There is pain inside of me
Worse than you could ever see
That is all because of you

What I try to understand
Is why you chose to take my hand
And lead me into misery

What you did, you did to hurt
Treating me like so much dirt
Was it all for play or show?

Took away my long for love
And I&#39;ve come to see my fate
It is all filled up with hate

There is pain inside of me
Worse than you could ever see
That is all because of you

What I try to understand
Is why you chose to take my hand
And lead me into misery

I have these scars from breaking free
Scars that only I can see
Some of the things that I should do
Remove all memory of you

You keep hurting,
You keep hurting,
You keep hurting me

You keep hurting,
You keep hurting,
You keep hurting me</info>
