 <info>Lyrics:
One day I&#39;m going to Malta to big hotel
In the morning I go down to eat breakfast
I tell the waitress I want two pieces of toast
She brings me only one piece
I tell her I want two piece
She says go to the toilet
I say you don&#39;t understand
I want two piece on my plate
She say you better no piss on the plate
You son of a b**ch!
I dont even know the lady
And she calls me a son of a b**ch

I go to eat at a bigger resturant
The waitress bring me a spoon and a knife, but no fork!
I tell her I want the fork
She&#39;s telling me everyone want to f**k
I tell her you don&#39;t understand
I want a fork on the table
She say you better not f**k on the table
You son of a b**ch!
I dont even know the lady
And she calls me a son of a b**ch

So i go back to my room in a hotel
And there is no sheets on the bed
Call the manager and tell him I want a sheet
He tells me go to the toilet
I say you don&#39;t understand
I want a sheet on my bed!
He say you better not s**t on my bed
You son of you b**ch!

I go to the check out
and the man in the desk says Peace on you
I said piss on you too you son of a b**ch!
Im goin back to Italy, Arrivederci</info>
