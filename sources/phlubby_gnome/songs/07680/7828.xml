 <info>Lyrics:

(whispering) I turn my back to all the shadows of my past, when I reach out to the heavens and the stars.

Long enough I ran from my fears…
Never again Will I cry any tears…
Long enough Life played it&#39;s tricks on me…
Now I&#39;m here - and I will not surrender!

Trusting in my destiny
filling my lungs with the whole eternity
looking forward - never looking back again
finally; I know who I am!

It has to be the downfall of illusions
The steady up and down and myself right in between
It has to be the imagery - so manyfold
That I can still believe in my emotions.

… So manyfold
That I can still believe in my emotions!

Surrounded by delight I feel Power, feel Control
Surrounded by delight I feel Power, feel Control
Surrounded by delight I feel Power, feel Control
Surrounded by delight I can be anywhere, anytime!

I will dominate my world (4x)

I dominate (6x)</info>
