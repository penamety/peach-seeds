Lyrics:
Wiggle it now, come on shake it.
This, this fight goes on.

Wiggle it now, come on shake it.
Shake, shake it no one leaves.
This fight goes on.

Wiggle it now, come on shake it.
Pull up your sleeves.
This fight goes on.

Wiggle it now, come on shake it.
Shake, shake it no one leaves.
This fight goes on.

Shake, shake it, shake it
No one leaves, pull up your sleeves.
Wiggle it now, come on shake it.
Shake, shake it.

Shake, shake it.
Wiggle it now, come on shake it.
Pull up your sleeves.
This fight goes on.

Wiggle it now, come on shake it.
Shake, shake it.
No one leaves.
This fight goes on.</info>
