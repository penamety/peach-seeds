 <info>&#34;This song was published in December 1992 with the title name &#34;Agony Screams&#34; within the &#34;Mirror&#34; music disk, by Andromeda. (http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=3614) The reason for the title change I think had to do with &#34;It&#39;s so cool&#34; name was too long for the menu selector or something. Or Mr.Hyde just had fun with renaming my modules maybe. :) I believe the song was composed somewhat earlier 1992, maybe during the summer holiday. I had just bought myself a Yamaha TG-77 synth and a Boss DR660 drum machine, and was so impressed by the fresh sounds - it was &#34;just so cool&#34; to compose music again! :) Thinking of remixing this track and update it to MP3 format someday. :)&#34;</info>
