 <info>&#34;As performed at Magfest 8, in January 2010. This isn’t the original song just run through chip synths, it’s almost entirely rewritten to account for how sloppy my playing was on the full production. Chip instruments are much less forgiving and stick out terribly if they’re just a little bit off, so I just selected everything and hit delete. Since I had improvised the guitar and bass while recording, they never existed as notation and I had to transcribe them and re-play on keys. The synths used are VOPM, Yamaha TX81Z, and Plogue Chipsounds.&#34;</info>
