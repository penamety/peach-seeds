 <info>was done when i&#39;ve got my microwave 2 (really cool synth) most of the instruments are from it...
unforunately isn&#39;t my happiest song shortly before i realised i&#39;ve got ripped off on ebay by 850â‚¬ when i was trying to by a tb 303...anyway

all voices are played live was more or less a live session...
and just did the arrangement later in cubase...
