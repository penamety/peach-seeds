THE ALAN SUGAR TRASH ORCHESTRA
============================================================
(C) 2015 by KMP

==============================
** Announcement **
==============================

Welcome to the show
And enjoy
The Alan Sugar Trash Orchestra

==============================
** Tuning the instruments **
==============================

I believe we have computer systems
Which are much better than yours
I believe we have floppy diskettes 
Which are much better than yours

I believe we have some really great games
Which are much better than yours
I believe we have some joysticks
Which are much better than yours

And our t-shirts are better than yours
And our scene is better than yours
And our „Pepperschnaps“ is better than yours
And our „AMIGA“ is better than yours

Amstrad! - Am, Am, Amiga
Amstrad! - Amiga, Amiga, Amigaaaaaaah!
Amstrad! - Ami… Amiga! Arrr-migaaah!
Amstrad! - Amiga, Amiga! Arrr-migaaah!

And our t-shirts are better than yours
And our scene is better than yours
And our Pepperschnaps is better than yours
And our „AMIGA“ is better than yours

==============================
** Bridge to the stairs **
==============================

And if i sit on my Amstrad (at my)
And i get quickly bored
Than i start my Soundtrakker
And i play this chord

==============================
** Chord of heavenly bliss **
==============================

Then everything gets better 
Better, better, better, better
So much better than yours

Even our Amiga Ball is bouncing stronger 
But calculation takes so much longer
You have 16 bit and we have eight
You’re more an Atari 
And we are straight

Amstrad! - Amiga!
Amstrad! - Amiga!
Amstrad! - Amiga!
Amstrad! - OK, Amstrad!

==============================
** Closing announcement **
==============================

Thank you for listening to
The Alan Sugar Trash Orchester

==============================
** Interview with an user **
==============================

Ahm, what i like about the Amstrad?
The machine!
It’s such a great machine!
Its games are great
The demos are really bombastic
The scene is so great
The Amstrad joysticks are the most stable joysticks in the world
Ahm, the floppy …
The three inch floppy disc is unbelievable great
I, i like the whole thing
I really like the Amstrad
