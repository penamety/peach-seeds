 <info>&#34;Ursula (part 2)&#34; by Yerzmyey. (C) 2015.

This song has been made entirely on Raspberry Pi 2. Also, it has been recorded directly from the machine. 
22 channels have been used.

Generally, the R_Pi&#39;s sound is being generated by the Broadcom BCM2835 chip (for model &#39;1&#39; of the R_Pi) and by Broadcom BCM2836 chip (in model &#39;2&#39; of the R_Pi) - and in my case it&#39;s the BCM2836 chip - so it&#39;s resolved somewhat like in ZX Spectrum: the sound is being generated by CPU.

It works with 11 bit quality. It&#39;s not an actual DAC, it is a digital PWM module (gives a &#39;pulse width modulated&#39; signal) working with frequency around 40MHz and it is low-pass-filtered.

The funny thing is, I also rendered the song directly into harddisk and compared it to the version recorded from real R_Pi: and I deleted the rendered file to hell, haha. The original Pi sound is warm&#39;n&#39;soft; doesn&#39;t remind thousands of razors.

Some people say R_Pi isn&#39;t good for music. 
They are WRONG.</info>
