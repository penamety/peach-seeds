 <info>New stuff. 
 Pure ZX Spectrum 48K with its powerful BEEPER, that is:

The Dynamic Duo ;) of ZX48 chips -

**Zilog Z80** and **Ferranti ULA** - 
 harnessed again, to generate more 1-bit music with strange new synthesis in 9 channels of sound (8 tones + drums).

I composed this song using a non-published (yet) engine programmed by Retrospec, based on the old good Octode. 
 Except the new way of synthesis, there are also introduced 2 levels of volume (4 loud and 4 quieter channels). 
 Hence - more space, more weight, in Beeper music. 
 Recorded from real hardware.

Compiled data (TAP file) is only 8Kb big (which is small for the Octode and its clones).

The song itself is a kind of &#39;funky / ballad&#39;, I don&#39;t know if you would like it. 
 So enjoy anyway, even though ballads never win compos, and I put it into BotB: 
battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/Intâ€¦ar+Drift/16364/

Composed in the end of 2014 year.

PS: So - it has won the compo after all!!!! :)
