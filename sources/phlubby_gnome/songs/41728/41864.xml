 <info>My entry for the Oldskool Music competition at Revision 2015. 
Aimed for catchiness, following the &#34;AHX pop style&#34; from &#34;Smooth Talker&#34;, but it also has a kind of &#34;untz&#34; factor to it (at least it did on the party speakers :)

Composed pretty much in a hurry during March/April. The final touches were done on the train from Frankfurt to Saarbr√ºcken and at Revision 2015..</info>
