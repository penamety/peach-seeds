 <info>Coming from Atari/Amiga DemoScene (1988-1996) mainly coding demo in assembly code with Devpack ;-) 
I have restart demoscene some years ago with my first 3D engine based on DirectX 9 (started in 2010). 
and release the Project 2401 at Evoke 2014. Of course with family/children/work that&#39;s not easy to
work full time on it ;-)

At the begining of this year, i have found Cinder Framework and ShaderToy.com website, with a lot of great shader effect remember me old school demo coding on my Amiga in asm :-p

And that&#39;s it.. first little demo with this new great tools... 
Of course that&#39;s not the greatest/smallest/Brillant demo like Cocoon/Mercury/Fairlight but just for me some way to make dreams and make some &#34;artistic expression&#34;...

Difficult to explain on all people around me that you can make Computer Art as Developper...

Personal Greetz flying to : Mike, Autopsy, JMZ, JoSsS, IQ, Frafra, Renaud, Phil &amp; some other people 
i have meet during these years... 

Enjoy &amp; CU for a next Release...
