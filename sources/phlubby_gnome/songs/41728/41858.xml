 <info>I decided to compose a remix of the Demo Tune 10 as it seems to named :) It&#39;s one of the The Deadline tunes ( 2nd part music) released by Finnish Gold.
This is my first touch for C-64 music since 1990, so I&#39;ve been out the scene 25 years:) time flies....
I played quitar and bass lines and for drums used Ez Drummer. Original C-64
 lines are spiced with some effects like Reverb, Delay, Wah and Chorus.
Enjoy and feel free to comment!
Cheers!
