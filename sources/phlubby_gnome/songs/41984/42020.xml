 <info>Ranked 13# place on Music Contest 6 at the intermediate division. 

An orchestral ballad that has a kinda Castlevania vibe (it comes to my mind to think in which it reminds me of) to it, it might get boring at times.. however, it&#39;s quite well done though. Well, the only problems here is the low quality of samples and lack of harmony.</info>
