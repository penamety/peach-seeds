_______________


This song was written on September 9th, 1998 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I spent the whole afternoon on it. Finished in about five hours.

Dedicated to Oliver Rauert, my Warhammer adversary, and all members of
our Friday-night Roleplaying Party: Oliver Bambach, Betina Schoenbrod,
Martin Vagedes, Ricardo Kirkner, Maximo Perez-Toews, 
Cecilia Lueg and myself.

The sample credits for this song go to Pulse, Skaven, Purple Motion,
Necros, Andreas Viklund and Elwood.  The drumtrack sequence has been
ripped from &#34;Drifting onwards&#34; by Pulse.

Greetings and all the Best to all my friends in Argentina, Germany
and elsewhere.

Hope you like this tune!
