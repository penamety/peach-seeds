               This is a song about a warrior leaving home and love for war.
                    He leaves a worlds of love for a world of hate.
       He will fight battles,kill people,because he is a warrior and his country
                          and his king wants him to do so
                    Whenever a warrior enters such a world of hate
                    you never know if you&#39;ll see him again, one day.
         This is a song for all the soldiers around the world, far from home.
                           Such things should never happen...
