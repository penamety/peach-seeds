<p>Dedicated to my sister Anya</p>

<p>Scenery:</p>

<p>A barbarian raiding party sets foot on a snow covered island which is only<br />inhabited by woodsmen and farmers. They attack the town.<br />It is an uneven battle, the townsmen are no match for the savage<br />attackers. Even the town&#39;s priest is no threat for them, and he is<br />defeated soon.<br />A dark figure walks calmly through the town while the battle is still<br />raging.<br />He reaches for the priest&#39;s chest and takes an amulet from the dying<br />body. Then he orders his horde to burn the town and to return to the<br />ships.<br />The blazing fire lights up the sky even more than the dawning sun.</p>

<p>Up on the hill, a young woodcutter cannot believe what he is seeing. The<br />bodies of his people are scattered on the ground. The snow is inked in<br />red, and the pirates&#39; ships are still visible hear the horizon.</p>

<p>The town was not rich, so their bounty must have been small. &#34;Why would<br />they have attacked?&#34;, he asks the wind.</p>

<p>It takes him days to bury the dead. Since there are no more hunters<br />patrolling the woods, wolves already dare to come nearer over the edge of<br />the hills...</p>

<p>Soon, the lonely woodcutter manages to repair a boat and ventures a sea<br />journey.<br />He hopes to reach the continent, to find out more about the barbarian<br />horde and what they had come for if it wasn&#39;t for gold...</p></i>
