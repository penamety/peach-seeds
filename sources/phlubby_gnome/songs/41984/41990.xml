Don&#39;t slam the door
===================

Written by Gargoyle
July 11th/12th 1998


I don&#39;t know, it seems to me that I&#39;ve heard this melody before...
or something similar... But I think the title fits well.

Greetings to

Zaba, Scirocco, GDJ, my friends in Germany and Argentina, Phantasma,
Jeffrey Lim, and to Necros and Lizardking because I&#39;ve ripped their
samples.
