 <info>Chanel5 strikes again with another crappy punk rock, listen it at your own risk. (lol)

Entry for multichannel compo at Assembly &#39;95, I regret everything.. I regret everything that I&#39;ve ever done why I uploaded this piece of crap.

Lyrics:

Hahahaaa. This song sucks, woohoo.
Let&#39;s kick some aaaaasss!

There&#39;s no light, there&#39;s always dark
There&#39;s too dark, I have to fart
If I asked you, would you show the way
or should I just... DRIIIIIIFT AWAAAAAAY! *wah*

Shoot yourself, you were innocent
Anarchy has caused another accident

One, two, three! Kill then me, kill da Doctor Destiny!
(^ and then it repeats this part all over to the end)</info>
