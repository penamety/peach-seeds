Lyrics:

Yo, yo! Let&#39;s go!

This is Leinad of Avalanche fame
I&#39;m out of money and know what to blame
But I got an idea.. why don&#39;t you vote4me?
In the music competition and then we&#39;ll see

I will be so happy with the tiny little prize
Of course, I will mind some cash
But if you vote4me and I&#39;ll be among the free
Chances off that you will leave to see tomorrow(?)


-repeat-
Vote4me!
I wanna win the competition (yeah)
Vote4me!
I wanna have sum bitchin&#39; (uhuh)
Vote4me!
I wanna win the competition
Vote4me! (uhuh-uhuh)
-repeat-
