&#34;MTV&#39;s decades is sponsered in part by the Amiga computer from commodore
and by the Nintendo entertainment system&#34;

Hey listen!

It all began back in &#39;85,
wasting hours waiting on my 1541-drive.
Playing Syndicate on my Commodore 64
Everything was better before...

The years went by and in &#39;89,
I got me an Amiga from the 500-line,
8-bit tracker fan and it all begam with Turrican
and Octalyzer made me a..... Music-man!

Here we go again! The time has come for more!
Once again we ramble on about that everything was better before!
Playing Monty on my Commodore!
When the games were in their prime!
Let me take you back in time! x2

Hey listen!

In &#39;94 came the psONE!
Once again an epic journey in my time begun!
Gaming every day in the atmosphere of Metal Gear
and Silent Hill was absolute..... FEAR!

The next year came the N64,
they just don&#39;t make&#39;em like those on it any more!
Legendary games out of Tokyo - like Mario
and every other hero should shrink... Compared to Link!

Here we go again! The time has come for more!
Once again we ramble on about that everything was better before!
Playing Monty on my Commodore!
When the games were in their prime!
Let me take you back in time! x2 </info>
