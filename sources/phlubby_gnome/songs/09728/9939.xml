 <info>Lyrics:
Lyrics are as follows:

Niiiiiintendo .... wohoooo!

I remember a time that I was sitting alone.
And playing my Amiga at home.
Gaming Maniac Mansion and Lotus Turbo,
and U.F.O Enemy Unknown.
Sitting on my ass - doing nothing at all.
But managing in Ports of Call.
No chance in hell I would ever ever get bored of;
killing NVA in Dogs of War.

Yeah, I&#39;m a gamer forever.
I&#39;m gaming whatever.
Together with my lads &#39;til I die.
I&#39;m gaming forever.
I&#39;m gaming whatever.
Together with my ladies &#39;til I die.
