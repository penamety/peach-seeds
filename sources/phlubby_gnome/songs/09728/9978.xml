 <info>You know, Mrs Torrance, you gotta keep regular if you wanna be happy.
We got canned fruits and vegetables, canned fish and meats. We got hot and cold cereals, Post Toasties, Corn Flakes, Sugar Puffs, Rice Krispies, oatmeal, Wheatina and Cream of Wheat.

I wanna make you shine
I wanna make you shine
I wanna make you shine

You know, Mrs Torrance, you gotta keep regular if you wanna be happy.
Come and play with us, daddy. Forever and ever and ever.
