 <info>This is not a tune about werewolves, or living deads, or Michael Jackson ;) It&#39;s just like a soundtrack about a strange night under the moonlight. A friend had asked me to make this music for his Amiga&#39;s 3D demo . Finally he did not like. The title comes from the name of the recording studio, where one of my favorite rockband &#34;Extreme&#34; has made the album &#34;Waiting for the punchline&#34;, because it was very evocative and poetic. Comments are welcomed. </info>
