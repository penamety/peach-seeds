 <info>This is the second tune I did for the yet to be released FLT intro called &#39;Beaufort&#39;, and as far as I can remember, the second tune I did with the first VST version of Smash&#39;s synth. Despite some obvious flaws in the quality of the instruments and mixing, I like this one. Probably the closest I&#39;ve come to a ridiculously dramatic theme that some demo groups seem to specialise in.</info>
