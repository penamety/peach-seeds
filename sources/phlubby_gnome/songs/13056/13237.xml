 <info>Space song. When I started working with my first tracker, I had a few disks of sounds, perhaps 5 or 6. Fortunately I got the &#39;ACTION REPLAY cartridge&#39; for the Amiga 500 with which I have ripped a lot of samples in my video games or on demo disks. After I had 22 disks sounds of all kinds. Otherwise I think I would have been very limited to compose things. Now with the Internet you will find everything what you want. Comments are welcomed. </info>
