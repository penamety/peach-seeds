 <info>Another co-op work with phaser. The composition was primarily done by phaser, I added the lead for the end part and mixed the tune (of which I&#39;m not too proud of). One of the VST synths used added some additional clicks and pops to the tune but I couldn&#39;t find the effort to try and fix it.</info>
