 <info>Partial lyrics:

As we sail across the sky
No longer visible to the eye
We are free from reality
We are the ones you cannot see

Keep on gaining altitude
Higher and higher, me and you
Until the Earth is a bright blue dot
Until each other is all we&#39;ve got

As we sail across the sky
No longer visible to the eye
We are free from reality
We are the ones you cannot see

Keep on gaining altitude
Higher and higher, me and you
Until the Earth is a bright blue dot
Until each other is all we&#39;ve got

Glider rider in the sky
Take me with you for a while
Life is so hard to live down here
Take me with you way up there
