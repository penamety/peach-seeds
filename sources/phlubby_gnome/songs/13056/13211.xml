 <info>Firebird, 1988

The recording is taken from Stone Oakvalley&#39;s collection

This seems to be a tough song for SID to play due to the heavy use of samples.

This 8580-R5-chip recording was the only one in which a lead instrument was clearly audible during the &#34;chorus&#34; so I picked this one. However, R5 recording has too silent intro so I took the first ten seconds from a 6581-R2 recording.

Especially the end sounds murky but so it does in the other recordings as well...</info>
