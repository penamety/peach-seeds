 <info>What the hell Ron ... are you sick?

Ehm.. Ehm .. No, well, have been, but that has nothing to do with the choice of this song. And no, I&#39;m not my faith cases (at least not yet), but I just wanted to know if I instead of always that little string and sweet melodies also have a dance number could write.

Or is this achieved? No idea .... here may you judge.
