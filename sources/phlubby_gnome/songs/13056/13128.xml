 <info>My second, and last, experience in writing game music was a fiasco, at least, than financial. The owner of the company what the game has released the geflest lot has happened to the money and run away. Sad for me, but a piece sneuer for the programmer of the game ... who has 2 years in the making and not a penny. I immediately had my fill and I never go 1 more note written for companies outside the Netherlands.
