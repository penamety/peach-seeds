 <info>In 1991 I had the honor of what later proved to be the most popular Amiga shoot&#39;m up game, Battle Squadron, the music may write. Although I had to introduce music into assembler code, it was a great experience, later thinly repeated with The Plague.

Years later I was approached by the German producer Jan Zotmann the soundtrack to play again for the CD series &#34;Immortal&#34;</info>
