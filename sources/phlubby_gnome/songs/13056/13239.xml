 <info>An oppressive track which sounds like a marching army and destroying everything in its path and that we can not stop. It all began with the sample &#39;String Meg&#39; and this feeling of chaos and power. The tune was built slowly because I didn&#39;t have a clear idea of development. But I wanted to have a very calm and soothing moment in the middle and then to continue with violence. March of time was the perfect way to describe this module. Comments are welcomed. </info>
