 <info>yesterday i was cleaning the attic and i found one of my old toys i used to play as a child. it was broken and full of dust but it was special... it held the remembrance of how much time i have spent playing alone in my own world surrounded with safetiness. how much i didn&#39;t care about the world... then i suddenly grew up and all has torn appart. and now i&#39;m just thinking of those days and wish if it could only last a little bit longer. but i know that this moment will sit in my heart and will fade into memory...
so i went down and had to make this remix as i really loved the low-res graphics demo show on c64 where this tune was used...can&#39;t recall it though...i&#39;m losing it...

thanx to marc for the original sid.</info>
