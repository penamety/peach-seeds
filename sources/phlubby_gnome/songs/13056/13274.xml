 <info>A tribute to Chris HÃ¼lsbeck and Jochen Hippel where I tried to mimic their composing styles. This tune was originally composed with hardware synthesizers using Sonar back in 2000 for an oldshool-styled demo but the demo was never finished so the tune never got released either. I recreated the project in Cubase and changed it to use only virtual synthesizers.</info>
