 <info>I came in the bar that night
And I saw her standing there.
She didn&#39;t look like a Rasta,
But I didn&#39;t really care.
I got lost in her eyes at once
And I asked her for her name.
She said her name was Giana
And that her life was like a game.

Ohh...
Ohh...

She said she must be on her way
And she left me standing there.
I couldn&#39;t close my mouth,
No, all I could do was stare.
I never met such a girl,
Never think I will meet one again,
But she&#39;ll be with me in my mind
And I&#39;ll keep looking just the same.
