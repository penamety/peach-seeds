<br />Additional Information:<br /><i><p>The world would be much better if there was no sex at all:<br />All men could sit all day, watch soccer and have a ball.<br />But due to evolution, we developed this here thing:<br />It&#39;s called a cock, and it needs to be put in.<br />My life would be so easy if there were no women at all,<br />But who would wash my clothes and clean the garden that fall?</p>

<p>Women are scary, but we love them anyway.<br />Life wouldn&#39;t be complete if they vanished into space.</p>

<p>So now I&#39;m getting calls from female organisations,<br />Telling me I&#39;m a big dick, and I guess that could be true.<br />But listen to what I&#39;m saying, and please don&#39;t get me wrong.<br />I don&#39;t mean to be rude; I&#39;m just singing a fucking song.<br />Cook me food, wash my clothes, clean the flat, I love you.<br />I&#39;ll wash the car, paint the house, if you give me love so true.</p>

<p>Women are scary, but we love them anyway.<br />Life wouldn&#39;t be complete if they vanished into space.<br />Maybe they should, though, &#39;cause shit is what men are,<br />But so are they: they&#39;re only human, after all.<br />Women are scary, women are scary, women are scary,<br />And they&#39;re shit, and so are we.<br />We&#39;re all shit, we&#39;re all shit, we&#39;re all shit, we&#39;re all shit,<br />We&#39;re all shit &#39;cause (??? humans are).<br /></p></i>
