 <info>The world would be much better if there was no sex at all:
All men could sit all day, watch soccer and have a ball.
But due to evolution, we developed this here thing:
It&#39;s called a cock, and it needs to be put in.
My life would be so easy if there were no women at all,
But who would wash my clothes and clean the garden that fall?

Women are scary, but we love them anyway.
Life wouldn&#39;t be complete if they vanished into space.

So now I&#39;m getting calls from female organisations,
Telling me I&#39;m a big dick, and I guess that could be true.
But listen to what I&#39;m saying, and please don&#39;t get me wrong.
I don&#39;t mean to be rude; I&#39;m just singing a fucking song.
Cook me food, wash my clothes, clean the flat, I love you.
I&#39;ll wash the car, paint the house, if you give me love so true.

Women are scary, but we love them anyway.
Life wouldn&#39;t be complete if they vanished into space.
Maybe they should, though, &#39;cause shit is what men are,
But so are they: they&#39;re only human, after all.
Women are scary, women are scary, women are scary,
And they&#39;re shit, and so are we.
We&#39;re all shit, we&#39;re all shit, we&#39;re all shit, we&#39;re all shit,
We&#39;re all shit &#39;cause (??? humans are).
