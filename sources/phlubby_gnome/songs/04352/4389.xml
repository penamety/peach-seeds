 <info>You came from heaven, sent to fill me up with joy.
My expectations rose as I played with my new toy.
The music was stomping; my heart was pumping, ready to explode.
Was it real or was it a dream? I could not really tell.
Now those days are gone, but the memory remains of you.

The ultimate game machine, the ultimate waste of time.
Sitting there for hours and hours: you became my life.
Overnight, a score: C64.

As I said, those days are gone. They won&#39;t be back for very long,
But when I fire you up again, I still feel full,
Full of energy that lies within this lump of plastic box
And the memory of old high scores and battles with my bro.

Another visitor! Stay a while. Stay forever!
I-Ball! Game over!

But then Amiga came and stole my heart from you.
I hope you will forgive me: I and you forever true.

The ultimate game machine, the ultimate waste of time.
Sitting there for hours and hours: the computer that was my life, C64.
