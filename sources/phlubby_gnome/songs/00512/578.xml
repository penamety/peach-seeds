 <info>&#34;How much hyperactive, ultra-melodic, super-chordy demostyle-dance can be crammed into 30 seconds? You don&#39;t wanna know... This was my entry for the Trax in Space 30-Second Compo 2000 (which, unfortunately, got cancelled due to lack of judges). A high-velocity, energetic, ultra-super-mega-caffeine-hyperactive bit of whimsy, dedicated to the legends of tracking who have inspired me with their fantastic music.&#34; --Beat</info>
