 <info>Made for the Amiga demo Fem by the prank group Laxative Effects. I used the fake nick Mr. Pizza when making music for Laxative Effects.

All demos were ofcourse unserious, and were most of the time made in Amos. Most of the music I made for that constellation were crap, but this one are actually quite cool :D

I won&#39;t out the other members of LAX though :)

Btw. This was not a module. It&#39;s streamed with ADPCM decoder in Amiga demo.
