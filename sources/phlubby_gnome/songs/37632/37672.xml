Dandilion Ride (VRC6, Jan 2012)

&#34;O&#39;hai.. Famicompo Mini 8 entry. 2nd Place! :D

I&#39;ve just realised I haven&#39;t made an mp3 of this available anywhere yet... better fix that. I guess I should also start uploading my music is more places, especially now that 8bc is dead (temporarily, hopefully)

By the way, I&#39;m fully aware that Dandelion is spelt wrong... unfortunately, I didn&#39;t realise this when I submitted the file in the first place, and cba to change it&#34;
