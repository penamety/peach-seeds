Well.. there are more than One year that i&#39;ve made and posted remix of video games.. not that i don&#39;t want to do.. but i&#39;ve switched from my old Impulse Tracker (running under MS Dos) to Buzz Tracker.. so i need time to learn and try ;p

In few days i&#39;ll launch my new album &#34;Just a smile&#34; and i decided to realise a video game mix to include in it. So i&#39;ve choose the forest theme of Donkey Kong Country 2 that i&#39;ve heard in some other remix this year, and that have an intersting melody.

so here is.. concept of the album is turning under theme of &#34;Miss Eskimo&#34; and her &#34;Sound Palette&#34;... so that&#39;s why it called Boreal Forest,.. and sounds like this ;p

so.. if u like this remix.. may be u&#39;ll like my forcoming album .. then stay tuned on http://cyborgjeff.untergrund.net in few days.. </info>
