This tune was originally composed for an intro which required clock cycle accurate timings so the tune doesn&#39;t use any timer effects. I was inspired by Jochen Hippel&#39;s tunes in some games like Rings of Medusa 2, and tried to come up with something similar. The tune is included in my music demo Meet !Cube.
