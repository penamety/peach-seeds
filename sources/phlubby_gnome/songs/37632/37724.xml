 <info>001	it was harder than		(8 bit - 4866)
002	i thought, to do a		(8 bit - 9400)
003	really new and			(8 bit - 9738)
004	different mix of this		(8 bit - 3900)
005	old classic. i still		(8 bit - 9900)
006	think it&#39;s one of			(8 bit - 9900)
007	the best songs ever		(8 bit - 2944)
008	made for the amiga...	(8 bit - 9000)
009	nevertheless i *had*		(8 bit - 4926)
010	to try at least. so		(8 bit - 950)
011	here is what i made		(8 bit - 3378)
012	of it, nothing really		(8 bit - 2300)
013	new, but i guess that	(8 bit - 786)
014	i will make up for		(8 bit - 4000)
015	that in the following		(8 bit - 3400)
016	songs that are to be	
017	&#34;improved&#34; by me.. :)	
018	comments about this	
019	remix, (and the ones	
020	to come), can be	
021	mailed to: d1rasmus @	
022	dtek.chalmers.se	
023	i like getting some	
024	other opinions than	
025	my own, so please	
026	drop me a line and	
027	tell me what u think.	
028	next song to be mixed	
029	will probably be the	
030	song by u4ia called	
031	not-just-any-trip
