 <info>I got home late
And I found your note on the kitchen table
The writing so perfect
There&#39;s no sign of emotion
The words inside
Blurred from tears in my eyes
You said that were leaving
And you said that you&#39;d tried

Oh why, did you have to leave
You might as well stick a knife in my heart
And leave me to die
Why did you have to leave
It feels like you&#39;ve stabbed me in the heart
When you left me to die

Well there&#39;s nothing left to say
For too many things have already been said
And if I can&#39;t make you love me
Then I guess it has to end here
Gave no reasons, made no accusations
Don&#39;t know why you want to leave me
But it&#39;s too late to fight for you

Oh why [tell me why], did you have to leave
You might as well stick a knife in my heart
And leave me to die
Why [tell me why] did you have to leave
It feels like you&#39;ve stabbed me in the heart
When you left me, you left me to die</info>
