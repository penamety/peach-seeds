 <info>The first tune I did and released under the Poise Records label. The tune itself consists of 3 various parts.. A short introduction followed by the mainpart and a more calm and relaxed endpart.

The tune, and especially the endpart, is inspired by The Crystal Method&#39;s song &#34;Keep Hope Alive&#34; from the movie &#34;The Replacement Killers&#34;.</info>
