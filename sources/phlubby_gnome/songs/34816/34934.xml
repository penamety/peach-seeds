 <info>This song is the final piece to the &#39;Eyes&#39; series, made as a short introduction to the album.

After more than two years, the album is complete, with this song being the last puzzle piece.

I don&#39;t really have much more to say about it apart from that it was meant to be similar to Memories so the two would constitute a kind of frame to the four &#39;big&#39; songs.

It was done in a few evening hours on January 10 and 11, 2012, as a break from studying medieval and renaissance literature :)</info>
