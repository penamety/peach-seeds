 <info>Even though this was released commercially, I just wanted to upload it here to show some respect to our late friend, Purplastic, a.k.a. Intensity of Gheymaid. Arman asked me to do this remix of his original Nathalia in late 2008 and it was finally released in late 2009.

I wish he finally found peace.</info>
