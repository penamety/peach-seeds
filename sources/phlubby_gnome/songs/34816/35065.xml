 <info>This is the first of two tracks that I&#39;ve composed for this excellent Scenesat release.
Originally, the tune was supposed to be accompanied by a demo. However, the demo wasn&#39;t finished so I decided to release it here as a standalone track. It&#39;s a pretty straightforward demo tune that was supposed to go along with crazy camera flying and a generally hard and tekky atmosphere. Repetitiveness for FTW!

&#34;Lyrics&#34;:
&#34;At the end of the synthesis I got in a very strange psychic situation.. A kind of dream world appeared. A feeling of oneness with the world. A very strange experience which reminded me of experiences I had in childhood.&#34; (A quote from Albert Hoffman on his experiences with LSD)</info>
