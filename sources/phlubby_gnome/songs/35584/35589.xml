 <info>Begun as a coop project together with Gustav. At the end of our session we said: &#34;This is not as good as it should be, lets put it on the shelf...&#34;
I added: &#34;Sure. Well, atleast now i have something to work on, should i get a flow.&#34;
On work 3 weeks later i cooked, cleaned, washed, served food for about 30 people, breakfast, lunch and dinner whilst also bringing my laptop beating the sense out of the musical part of my brain.
About 90% of the song was made that day.
When i woke up, i went to work. When i came home, i went to bed. A good day, all in all.</info>
