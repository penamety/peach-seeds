 <info>So - it&#39;s about time someone uses a wobble-
bass for something other than dubstep ;)

Great thanks to the organizers of Revision!
You&#39;re doing an amazing job for everyone
to have this awesome party-experience.

It&#39;s an amazing party and this year,
and there&#39;s even coffee. AND IT&#39;S FREE!

Not too much time and effort was put into
this tune compared to others I&#39;ve done,
but we were in quite a rush with our
64k intro (and the music for it) so that
had highest priority.

Hope you enjoy anyways, and ...
