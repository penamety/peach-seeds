This song was supposed to be my Music Contest 6 entry,
but unfortunate events (=hospitalization) prevented me
from partaking in it, and also from being a judge. I&#39;m
now releasing the song in the Return to Stage 9 musicdisk.

This is an early, original mix of the song; a newer,
improved mix will appear in Epic Megagames&#39; game Unreal
Tournament. Check it out.


Samples obtained from:

- Treponem Pal: Higher
- Think About Mutation: Virus
- Hannu &#34;Salomon&#34; Salonen (thanks!)
- Teque
- Vocals by me. --- Kidding. (Thanks to General 6000)

----------------------------

Enter the mutant traitor
Burning oh so bright
In this corrupted nature
I see no other light

- -

Addicted to radiation
Fueled by your pain
Aroused high by contamination
Soothed by acid rain

- -

Mother nature lied to me;
Betrayed on a killing spree
Mother nature expelled me;
What&#39;s the use now, that I&#39;m free
