 <info>hey global chipluverz!
After my trip to holland (zeeland)
my head is full cheesyness which needs
to be filled in +- 50kb .it container.

So I thought about the food, the girls
the ocean and other fine specials holland
is so famous for ;) and created this
&#34;hymn&#34; for my memories... yayz
Cheesy track, cheesy comment.

So turn up the volume, loop it a few
times, to get the &#34;lekker&#34; ko0x
flavor.
