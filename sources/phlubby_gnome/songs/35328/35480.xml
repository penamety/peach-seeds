 <info>If it&#39;s the little things that count
Then I&#39;ll be counting on myself

In my den I&#39;ll be going at it once again
Hoping it&#39;s a question of when

Inside
Anger grows, (each other more)
And maybe then I&#39;ll grow some more
And wait for the old days

Inside
Sadness grows, (each other more)
And maybe then I&#39;ll grow some more
And wait for the old age
It is a win-win situation (ah na)

It&#39;s the little things that count
So I&#39;ll be counting on myself
In my mind I&#39;ll be trying hard to break the noise
Hoping it&#39;s a question of choice

You&#39;ll always hear it in my voice</info>
