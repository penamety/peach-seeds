 <info>Lyrics:
There must be something I forgot
I have this feeling
There must be something I forgot
Cause when I connect
My hand to my ears
I tend to forget my head, my heart, my blood, my tears
There must be something I forgot
I feel I must have felt a lot
I&#39;m sure of it now
My tears, my blood, my hands, and my heart

It could be night, it could be day
It could be this home of brick
Or it could be nineties music
It could me, or it could be you
Many things have crossed my mind
It could be all these things combined

There must be something I forgot
I have a feeling
I feel I must have felt a lot
Please help (???)
My head, my blood, hands, and my heart
Cause it&#39;s killing us

I haven&#39;t been beyond this day
I really could have tried
I should have been beyond this day
But I haven&#39;t even tried
I haven&#39;t even tried
I&#39;ll never even try
I haven&#39;t been beyond this day
Cause I&#39;ve never really tried
I&#39;ve never even tried
My tears, my blood, my hands, and my heart
I feel it in every body part</info>
