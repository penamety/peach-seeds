 <info>Done for the sample pack compo. It was done seriously, as i enjoy tracking with one sample, but i of course knew it would end up in bottom bunch, not in top, so it&#39;s not a serious effort compowise, if you know what i&#39;m talking about :D Title is Zeta because i didn&#39;t have any tune beginning with &#34;Z&#34;.

Oh yeah, the &#34;transition&#34; in 1:49 or so is not an accident but done intentionally :)</info>
