 <info>Can’t you see that my opinion on you 
is made up from the art of showing that you don’t have a clue 
and I got that you’re pitying me 
although your lacking self-awareness is your sole reason to be 
I believe your beliefs must be true 
because the world you live inside approves your own point of view 
only that you’re worshipping god 
expresses powerful denial of the things that you’re not 

Chorus 

Your ignorance is bliss, I suck at this, 
my questions pile while you&#39;ll still pray 
Your deep convictions are just fed by evidence that contradicts 
it’s self-delusion, no conflicts 

Quench your thirst for the utmost enlightment 
turn your fear into the right to be afraid to be frightened 
all your sins are deleted - only wishful thinking, 
yes, my soul will rot in hell but yours is already stinking 
your servility, it makes a walking dead I can assure 
you are the prey of tyranny, enslaved for life and then you’re 
dropped dead, vanished, gone forever 
but still obeying the master, it’s your final endeavour 

Chorus 

Bridge 

Everything’s a matter of perspective 
still your truth’s highly selective 
the wish for heaven is effective 
it is your primary objective 

Solo
