 <info>English Translation:

it doesn&#39;t help to talk about it
it doesn&#39;t help to be sorry
all those sorrows do not help
it doesn&#39;t help to not cheer up

it doesn&#39;t help to achieve something
it doesn&#39;t help, even if one&#39;s right
it doesn&#39;t help to be like others
and if it helps, it helps poorly

ref.
and when the press writes and writes
how everything vanishes/works and everything remains
a generalisation doesn&#39;t help
only my gentle sweetheart helps
and whatever television tells
how one feels, so one votes/chooses
a generalisation doesn&#39;t help
only my gentle sweetheart helps

it doesn&#39;t help to think of oneself
it doesn&#39;t help to screw with oneself
it doesn&#39;t help to give oneself away
it turns out different than one believes

it doesn&#39;t help to understand it
there is no difference
it doesn&#39;t help, because it doesn&#39;t work like that
even this song doesn&#39;t help </info>
