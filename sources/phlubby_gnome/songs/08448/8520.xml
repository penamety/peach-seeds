 <info>&#34;Stranglehold&#34; came to be a couple of days before Christmas 1995 when I decided to take up the challenge to use only 1 sine wave sample to create an entire piece of music. The only thing to be manipulated was the pitch and the volume of the sine waves.

According to quite a few people, the song started a whole new music genre, but I won&#39;t claim credit for that... or do I? ;-)

I used Fasttracker 2.08 (a tracker program) to compose the song.
At the time the most popular music tracker around.

The tune is 14622 bytes in file-size (15 KB) and has been extensively used in cracktro&#39;s, has been used to test and tweak mod-players like XMplay, Winamp, and the likes. There are many remixes of the song around. Just google for &#34;Stranglehold Jeroen Tel (WAVE).&#34;

The original file (XM module) can be found as &#34;jt_strng.xm&#34; (just google it) and is best played using XMplay (www xmplay com)

I hope this tune will sooth your ears / mind / soul and heart.

Let peace rule your life! Tune into it.

Big hello&#39;s and greetings to all my fellow tracker friends from back then at #TRAX (mIRC). I miss you, guys! This track is dedicated to those times! I&#39;m copying and pasting a greet list from back then right here in your honor. Hope you all are well!
