???... out the style
MC Nach is the top of the file
My file be packin&#39; it with the potent information
Talk about the ??? lovin&#39; the masturbation
Bringin&#39; it to you live from the top of the nation
Thinkin&#39; my flow is gonna survive the tribulation
Fornication, precursor to relation
Think that all your hoes like procrastination
Bitches, hear me out, y&#39;all gotta get a clue
I know a thing or two about a thing or two
Finger to the moon like Bruce, yeah, the thing I&#39;m most hell-bent
Spittin&#39; out rhymes with emotional content
Call it white-fu, it&#39;s the art of the flowin&#39;
Ability to paraphrase the sound of bitches blowin&#39;
Goin&#39; down further than the city of Atlantis
Knowin&#39; they ain&#39;t got shit on my antics

We got it goin&#39; on [at five pitches?]
We got the funk and we&#39;re scratching all the itches
You chumps envy my heavy and all my riches
This goes out to all my bitches

Y&#39;all my bitches, every last one o&#39; you
In my spare time I make effort to make fun of you
Front of you, side of you, behind your back, over you
Whether you a Honda Civic or Ranger Rover you
Are my bitch; all you play is ??? hoes
Nobody knows a Semite with a more hooked nose
And my nose hangin&#39; from the ceilin&#39;
You bitches got ???
You know ??? got the feelin&#39;
You know I got it goin&#39; it on, nine to five, Tinder life, with your wife
And your daughter, the ??? knife sharper than a Bowie knife
And it&#39;s cuttin&#39; through the cream with a crop
Didn&#39;t know she was kinky and I thought she was a cop
I guess not; ??? just for play
Hope you don&#39;t see me at the end of the day
Gotta tip for ya, home, hide the adultery
Your bitch&#39;s tight ass is the place I wanna be

We got it goin&#39; on...

When they come around the bitch ??? at my cell
And my two-way ??? with the true way to hell
Hell, if I&#39;da known, I wouldn&#39;t have done her so fucking well
&#39;Cause I didn&#39;t know the bitch liked to kiss and tell
Shit, the gossip gets around; motherfuckers been talkin&#39; about
How the bitch knew me ??? rocket
Word hits a nigga; I&#39;m like &#34;oh shit, they hitched?&#34;
But then it hits me: I&#39;ll just make *him* my bitch
Gunpoint, fun point, with the semi-automatic
??? sayin&#39; this shit won&#39;t be democratic
I say &#34;on your knees, bitch ??? above me&#34;
Then I&#39;m like &#34;motherfucker, I&#39;ll fuck you till you love me&#34;
Ten minutes later, bitch wipin&#39; off his chin
The wife bitch ??? decides to walk in
&#34;Oh my God, whatcha do to my boo?&#34;
I&#39;m like &#34;shut your mouth, bitch, &#39;cause you&#39;re my bitch too&#34;

We got it goin&#39; on...

Heh-heh-heh, shit, I got bitches all over the place
Bitches in Mexico City, in Nebraska
J-Lo, she one o&#39; my bitches
All the Spice Girls, they my bitches
George W. Bush, definitely my bitch
Webster and Gary Coleman, both my bitches
Let&#39;s see... who else?
Madonna&#39;s my bitch, Linus Torvalds is my bitch
??? all five of the Backstreet Boys
Cleo the psychic
Michael George... ???
