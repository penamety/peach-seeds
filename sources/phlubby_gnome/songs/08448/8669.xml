 <info>Lyrics:
Stand aside, you can&#39;t collide
with a million years of pride and not fucking die
Conviction,
and with the power of hatred
I will crash the heavens and rape the sacred
Tension, pay no attention,
unbridled rage is the final dimension
Take back what was taken,
Burn the world for all crimes forsaken

Yeah! Straight from the top of my dome
as I rock rock rock, rock the microphone!

We are beyond the time of correction,
A rebuild now could only follow destruction
The system cannot be reformed,
the structure will never transform by itself

Yeah! Straight from the top of my dome
as I rock rock rock, rock the microphone!</info>
