This is probably the worst piece of music I&#39;ve ever done. Can&#39;t really find any inspiration, but wanted to get as much of that one sample, as possible.

It might not make any sense at all to you, but it really made a difference to me. And that&#39;s what really matters afterall :) Hope you like it too.

Hope you enjoy and ... P A N T S    O F F
