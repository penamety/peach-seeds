 <info>I made this song during my honeymoon at Rodney Bay, Saint Lucia in the Caribbean where I married my fiancé for the past eight years, Cathrine. Who brings a laptop to their honeymoon, let alone start composing music with earplugs in the evening? I know that’s weird :) .. 
No VSTi&#39;s .. only samples used, and it is also the first Renoise song I&#39;ve finished.</info>
