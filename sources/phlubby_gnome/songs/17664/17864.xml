 <info>epithal
of
limited edition
after been working on
a tune for aoi #2 for
almost 2 weeks i made
this from scratch in
3 hours...
during that time, i
spoke to skize about
20 of the time. this
is ironical!!!
personal greet to:
vermland mysterier.
sorry for using
glissando on the
piano! (where have i
heard this before :-)
find the secret part
in this tune!
to phookey: this one
got a bit big :-(..
hope it&#39;s no problem!
