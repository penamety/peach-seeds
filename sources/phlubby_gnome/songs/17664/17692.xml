 <info>In a demo by Edwin van Santen, which he released about two years after Coco Intro was made popular in the Papillion&#39;s crack intro, he claims that he in fact composed the music. This demo contained a new version of the tune (this sid). He explains how he had made the music two years earlier on some composer like Soundmonitor or something similar. While at a copyparty, someone supposedly stole his music disk which had the tune on it. This was his only copy of the tune. bout two months later, the tune appeared on a Papillions&#39; intro and no credit was given to van Santen. See Mueller_Markus - Coco_Intro.sid for more details.

Tune is sort of cover of &#34;You keep me hanging on&#34; originally written by Brian Holland and Lamont Dozier in 1966</info>
