 <info>DISABLED DUE TO COMMERCIAL MATERIAL.
Will have to contact the group: Every Little Thing and ask if we are allowed to play it on the radio.
As I don&#39;t understand squat japanese text or can&#39;t find a proper e-mail to contact at: http://www.avexnet.or.jp/elt/index.html
I&#39;ll leave it for someone else who&#39;s ambitious.

Update: I contacted AVEX NETWORK thru youtube and asked about this specific song, we&#39;ll see their response.
