 <info>Lyrics:
As leader I remain aware as they all sleep
I see my breath in the freezing air

Yet as I wander through the snow all alone
Can&#39;t help but feel at home
I wander

So silently I touch the ground that I traverse
Move swift without a single sound

And as I wander through the snow, I&#39;m strong alone
Can&#39;t help but feel at home
I wander

Predicting searching soulless eyes exit the dark
Emerging now from night&#39;s disguise

And as I hunt throughout the night
I walk alone
Can&#39;t help but feel at home
I&#39;m where I belong</info>
