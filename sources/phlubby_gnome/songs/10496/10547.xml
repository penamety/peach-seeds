 <info>Neat little piece. Actually, I can’t remember who Bonni was and why he (or she) was on the run, but I do remember that I wrote this tune for one of the TGM Demos. The rest of the crew was very upset by that demo because I did put a huuuuge “Lord Performer Artworx” and a mini “of TGM-Crew” into it… hehe… :)</info>
