 <info>Makke sings 80&#39;s top hit from Nik Kershaw (I won&#39;t let the sun go down on me)

Forty fools in the lobby.
Your mom is a dirty whore.
That is her favourite hobby,
Looking at the score.
She has been in all the houses
With a radius for miles and miles.
She has been in all the trousers
Of every guy you know in town.

Good or bad, like it or not,
She&#39;s the only mom you&#39;ve got.

I won&#39;t let your mom go down on me.
I won&#39;t let your mom go down.
I won&#39;t let your mom go down on me.
No, I won&#39;t let your mom go down.

Your mother&#39;s nature is on her back,
Three hundred million guys per year.
She has been in every sack
And now she&#39;s after mine. No fear!
Every man should watch their scrotum;
She has vacuum inside her head.
Four fingers up the bottom,
She will suck till the place is red.

Maybe I won&#39;t mind if she would.
I hear she sucks cock quite good, but

I won&#39;t let your mom go down on me.
I won&#39;t let your mom go down.
I won&#39;t let your mom go down on me.
No, I won&#39;t let your mom go down.
