original by basehead, remix by chuckbiscuits/kfmf, (c) copyright bh&amp;cb 94-96

taking you on an extended advent&#39;jah of the uk deep house vibe, here&#39;s my tip on basehead&#39;s 1994 classic

respect to those who put up with this track being mixed night and day for what must have seemed like forever;

accidental thanks to gracie for the bassline :); to charlton for the ideas, support and the positivity; kathy for the affection; marcus&amp;everyone for their love of house music; cam for the phat us grooves - best of luck;and to bh for his persistence in helping me remix his track :)

notes: ack! 6 months?!&lt;gag&gt;
. keep the deephouse vibe .
