(creation time: 5:30 hours)
This song written for REM Inc.&#39;s &#34;Damage&#34; Musicdisk July edition. The deadline is tomorrow (July 1st), so
I&#39;m kinda in a hurry to finish this song up, and considering I really only started this song yesterday I&#39;m quite happy with it.

Special thanks to Ryan/REN for the Layered Strings and Overture samples (Korg X3)
quick greets to Nemesis, Necros, ShadowHunter, Rimbo, Maelcum, Diablo, all the other EGG crew, and all the others I&#39;ve had the pleasure to meet &lt;g&gt;.
