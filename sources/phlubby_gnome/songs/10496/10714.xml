[Bioplastic - A Different Man]

Lyrics:

Behind the mirror lies a different man.
He hides from the others, the ones who are not like him.
In his mind there&#39;s always a liquid thought. He wants to be someone.

Someone meant to be seen, someone wants to be clean. But in his eyes everything&#39;s black.
Black like the sea at night. Noone will see what lies beneath.
Look at me why can&#39;t you see... 
See me?
Why can&#39;t you all be like me?

Dwelled in shadows lies a broken man.
Stalking the streets at night, avoiding the ones who are not like him.
In his mind there&#39;s always a dangerous thought. He wants to be someone.

Someone meant to be seen, someone wants to be clean. But in his eyes everything&#39;s black.
Black like the sea at night. Noone will see what lies beneath.
Look at me why can&#39;t you see... 
See me?
Why can&#39;t you all be like me?

In this room lies a convicted man.
Laughing at the others, that are not... like him. 
In his mind there was always one last thought. He needed to be someone.

Another shiny blade through the night.
Another throat cut without remorse.
Another body counted for. 

Someone meant to be seen, someone wants to be clean. But in his eyes everything&#39;s black.
Black like the sea at night. Noone will see what lies beneath.
Look at me why can&#39;t you see... 
See me?
Why can&#39;t you all be like me?</info>
