 <info>Well, I got myself some trouble with the missus, as you&#39;ll see.
She&#39;s forcing me to sit down every time I gotta pee,
But that&#39;s not the way to go for a man.
I stand up when I pee because I can.

I can&#39;t go wee wee when I sit,
&#39;Cause then my body wants to shit.

She says she won&#39;t be putting out until I obey,
But that&#39;s no trouble for a real man like me.
If she&#39;s hard to get, I grab my coat
And head out to the barn and fuck a goat.

I can&#39;t go wee wee when I sit,
&#39;Cause then my body wants to shit.
If I have to fuck the goat to (??? have my way)
Then that&#39;s the simple way it&#39;s gonna be.

Well, I got myself some trouble with the missus, as you&#39;ll see.
She&#39;s forcing me to sit down every time I gotta pee.
I guess that darn ol&#39; goat is getting tired of me now,
So next week I think I&#39;ll have a go at the cow.

I can&#39;t go wee wee when I sit,
&#39;Cause then my body wants to shit.
