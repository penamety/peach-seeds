 <info>Remix of the Jesus On E&#39;s soundtrack by Echo. Lyrics:

Ooh yeah! C&#39;mon!

My warped senses tell me
That nothing I see is real.
Saturday tends to betray me
Like a (??? suggester), you see.
The time to wonder ceases:
You&#39;ll (??? solely) see
That your religion&#39;s based on
Nothing but Jesus on E&#39;s.

Slam the door when you&#39;re leaving,
So I&#39;ll know for sure that you&#39;re gone.
??? (will try to compel?)
??? force is set free.

Reality&#39;s razors will teach you
That Satan is high on speed,
And LSD will convince thee
That Jesus was whacked on E&#39;s!
