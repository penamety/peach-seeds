 <info>There is a guy I know called Nate
Who can consume a whole damn crate
Of Guinness, if he gets the chance,
Which proves that he is not from France.

He resides somewhere in the UK
Where it rains every fucking day.
I&#39;m not sure, I have my doubts,
But I think that&#39;s why his site&#39;s called ???

Hooray, a chance for you!
There&#39;s no guy I&#39;d rather do
If I was gay, but since I&#39;m straight
I&#39;d rather make a song about the guy called Nate.

Metal detectors at Heathrow
Always refuse to let him through
&#39;Cause he&#39;s got piercings everywhere,
Kinda like a punk-rock Yogi Bear.
Oh wait, that was a bad rhyme.

If there was a World Cup in coolness, I&#39;d surely win.
I rock so radical, but I&#39;m sure Nate would be runner-up.

Hooray, a chance for you!
There&#39;s no guy I&#39;d rather do
If I was gay, but since I&#39;m straight
I&#39;d rather make a song about the guy called Nate.
Hooray, a chance for you!
There&#39;s no guy I&#39;d rather do
If I was gay, but since I&#39;m straight
I&#39;d rather make a song about the guy called Nate.
Hooray, hooray, for you...
