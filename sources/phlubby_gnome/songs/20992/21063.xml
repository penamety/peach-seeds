 <info>I had to rush this one together, from an old song I had lying around. But I hope you enjoy it, anyway, and I, uh, wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

Come all you shit kids.
Santa, he has been here
And he brought you presents that you have not deserved.
Come all you bastards
Yeah, you little demons
That had gone on my nerves for a whole year.

Here, my dear son:
Have this PS2 I bought.
I slaved at work for six months
Just to make you happy,
And for my little girl I bought this here TV.

So come all ye shit kids.
Santa, he has been here
And he brought you presents that you have not deserved.

Come all you bastards.
I spent a minor fortune
And what did I get from you? Jack shit, I believe.
