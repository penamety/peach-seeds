Merry Christmas !

this was originally done in december &#39;94 for imphobia magazine - but since their music system didn&#39;t support s3ms then, i have had it sitting around here... and decided to give it to this disk almost a YEAR later (phew!)... but i hope you enjoy it anyway...
(strange that i had x-mas greets and everything for x-mas &#39;94... and now it&#39;s already past x-mas &#39;95... ah well)

ps-this song was done when i was in imphobia/cascada
