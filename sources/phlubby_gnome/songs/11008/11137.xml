an 11:39 ambient voyage into the icy depths of our earth&#39;s sprawling bodies of water.
this is the preliminary release. once i buy 512k more GUSmax ram, i will do a full &gt;20min version of this, with plenty of new ambient grroves to chill to. also, don&#39;t count me out
i am also doing a 5th in the series. it will be out sometime in the future.
&#34;bubbly&#34; greets go to chuck biscuits, necros, lord pegasus, siren, simus, maelcum, epeius, rcramer, heatwave, mellow-d, stalker, bigjim, khyron, and every1 that makes #trax an &#34;occasionally&#34; cool place to hang out. thanks.
