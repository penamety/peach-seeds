enjoy this tune, as well as the rest of this musicdisk.. as i&#39;m sure it will be fantastic...! some of these samples are mine while some have been ripped from lord interface, sidewinder, and necros..
greets to all the irc guys and the members of both klf and mental design.. keep up the good work.
this song goes out to sai, with love, whom i catch my self daydreaming about on many a summer&#39;s day. =)
