that block of time of which is unaccounted for... your mind, in a haze about those hours that have passed... into which your experiences fall, never return...
hello again... this is my interpretation of an alien abduction... a 9 minute, and 14 second excursion into the unknown, have you ever been abducted? have you ever not been able to account for a good piece of a day? can you remember or recall the visions that haunted you when all was still?
try to remember... listen closely... and open your mind.
-bh -june 21, 1995 -a kosmic release
.... they&#39;re out there ...somewhere... (end of transmission))))))))
