hey kids... hope you enjoy this houz/tranz/breakbeat or whatever you want to call it track... =) i spent quite a bit of time on it and perharps i got carried away so sorry if it all doesn&#39;t go completely together... well like i said, enjoy it...
this track is for the musicdisk with stalker/fm and myself... i wanted to throw in something harder to show everyone that i&#39;m not all mellow and jazzy all the time =)
thanx to necros, because he sent me like a 5 pattern song on which this entire track based... plus he gave me a bunch of the samples...
other samples are from &#34;open your mind&#34; by 3Phase (cd), and also from Dr;Alban&#39;s &#34;it&#39;s my life (euromix)&#34; (cd), pitty/dytec&#39;s &#34;longing for techno 2&#34; mod, dune/orange&#39;s tune from the x-y-z demo, and last but not least... &#34;sax it up&#34; by saxmachine (cd)...

werdwerdwerdwerdwerdwerd...

peace-out!

-bh-june 26-1995- -btw, this song has NO resemblence to 3phase&#39;s &#34;open your mind&#34; ar all, except for the vocal.-
