 <info>basehead / kosmic $#@! in 1995
order 00-63  =   suburbia, order 64-113 = high hopes

hey! this is bh comin atcha once again, wif another kos release .. this one starts out with a sort-of oldskool deephouse groove, and then mixes in halfway thru to a huge overhaul/remix of the classic &#34;high-on-hope&#34; from the berlin 1992 compilation

the first part is complete and original, and the 2nd introduces some loops from mijk van dijk himself, the guy behind the brilliance of microglobe and mindgear.
anyways, enough small talk. hope you like the track !!!
